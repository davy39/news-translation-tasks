Servers are less essential to the work of front end develoers than they've ever been. We can now do things on the front end that used to require a back end.

In this talk, Chris Coyier shows how powerful front end developers actually are. When we do need a back end, our front-end skills can be put to work, giving us some surprisingly powerful new abilities. Chris shows off the tools, tech, and code that puts more power than ever into our front-end hands.

You can watch the video on the [the freeCodeCamp.org YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXJpOHz3_sY) (30 minute watch).‌
