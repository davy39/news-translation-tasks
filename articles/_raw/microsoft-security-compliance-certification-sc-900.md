## What is the Microsoft Security, Compliance, and Identity Fundamentals?

The Microsoft Security, Compliance, and Identity Fundamentals Certification is an essential entry-level certification into Azure and Microsoft Security.

In recent years we've seen a significant shift in the work environment where companies allow employees to work from home. 

The increase of IoT devices means we have more technology outside the office. The low cost of tablets and smartphones means we have more employees carrying around sensitive data. Companies are leveraging more cloud services, and employees can procure their software without the approval of a centralized IT department.

Our people, devices, and software are no longer contained within the boundaries of a single physical location. So we must change the way we think of cybersecurity by treating our primary security as being focused around Identity.

Microsoft's Active Directory is the industry standard for enterprise identity. With Microsoft's cloud variant Azure Active Directory, it is easy for a company of any size to have the best-in-class identity management and directory service and quickly implement a **Zero-Trust model**.

## **Overview of the** Microsoft Security, Compliance, and Identity Fundamentals

The Azure Data Fundamentals covers the following:

* Zero-Trust Model, Security, Compliance Concepts
* Azure AD
* M365 and Azure Defender
* M365 Compliance Center
* Various Azure Security and Networking Services

## How do you get the Microsoft Security, Compliance, and Identity Fundamentals certification?

You can get the certification by paying the exam fee and sitting for the exam at a test center partnered with Microsoft Azure.

Microsoft Azure is partnered with Pearson Vue and PSI Online who have a network of test centers around the world. They provide both in-person and online exams. If you have the opportunity, I recommend that you take the exam in-person.

Microsoft has [a portal page on Pearsue Vue](https://home.pearsonvue.com/Clients/Microsoft.aspx) where you can register and book your exam.

That exam fee is **$99 USD**.

## Can I simply watch the videos and pass the exam?

For a fundamental certification like the SC-900 you can pass by just watching the video content without exploring hands-on with the Azure services on your own.

The SC-900 is the most lecture heavy fundamental certification by Microsoft and that is because it is laying the foundation for four possible Security Associate certifications.

Azure has a much higher frequency of updates than other cloud service providers. Sometimes there are new updates every month to a certification however, the SC-900 is not hands-on focused, so study courses are less prone to becoming stale.

* The exam has **40 to 60** questions with a timeline of **60 minutes**.
* The exam contains many different question types.
* A passing grade is **around 70%.**
