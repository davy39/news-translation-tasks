Learn about the complete neural machine translation journey.

We just posted a course on the freeCodeCamp.org YouTube channel that is a comprehensive journey through the evolution of sequence models and neural machine translation (NMT). It blends historical breakthroughs, architectural innovations, mathematical insights, and hands-on PyTorch replications of landmark papers that shaped modern NLP and AI.

The course features:

* A detailed narrative tracing the history and breakthroughs of RNNs, LSTMs, GRUs, Seq2Seq, Attention, GNMT, and Multilingual NMT.
    
* Replications of 7 landmark NMT papers in PyTorch, so learners can code along and rebuild history step by step.
    
* Explanations of the math behind RNNs, LSTMs, GRUs, and Transformers.
    
* Conceptual clarity with architectural comparisons, visual explanations, and interactive demos like the Transformer Playground.
    

Here are all the sections in the course:

* Evolution of RNN
    
* Evolution of Machine Translation
    
* Machine Translation Techniques
    
* Long Short-Term Memory (Overview)
