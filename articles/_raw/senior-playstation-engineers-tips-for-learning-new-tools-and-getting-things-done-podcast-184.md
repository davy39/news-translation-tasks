On this week's episode of the podcast, freeCodeCamp founder Quincy Larson interviews Dilip Krishnamoorthi. He's a software engineer working at Sony, building user interfaces for Playstation game consoles where he's been for 10 years.

We talk about:

* How he dropped out of a traditional Indian university and used an inexpensive distance learning program to finish his engineering degree for less than US $100 / semester
    
* What it's like working in Bengaluru, the Silicon Valley of Asia
    
* His experience launching the Playstation 5
    
* Tips for continuing to learn new tools even as a senior engineer
