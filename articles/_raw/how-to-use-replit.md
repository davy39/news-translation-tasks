## How to create a free Replit account

To get started, you will first need to go to the [Replit homepage](https://replit.com/). In the top right hand corner, click on [Sign Up](https://replit.com/signup?from=landing).

You can create an account with your own username, email, and password. Or you can create an account using your Google, Facebook, or GitHub account.

## What is a Repl and how do you create one?

Repl stands for read-eval-print loop and it is an interactive programming environment for developers to create small projects.

In Replit, there are three places where you can create a new repl.

One way is to click on the `Create Repl` button located at the top left hand corner of the homepage.

![Image](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2021/11/Screen-Shot-2021-11-03-at-11.55.53-AM.png)

You can also create a repl by clicking on the `+` icon under the Create section.

![Image](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2021/11/Screen-Shot-2021-11-03-at-12.12.35-PM.png)

The last option is the click on the `+` icon located at the upper right hand corner.

![Image](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2021/11/Screen-Shot-2021-11-03-at-3.19.31-PM.png)

Then you can choose from one of Replit's many templates including Python, Node, Java, HTML & CSS, Ruby, and more. 

![Image](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2021/11/Screen-Shot-2021-11-03-at-11.58.45-AM.png)

Once you choose your language, pick a name for your project.

![Image](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2021/11/Screen-Shot-2021-11-03-at-11.59.58-AM.png)

For the free version of Replit, you are not allowed to create private projects. If you want a private repl, then you will need to upgrade to the paid subscription.

![Image](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2021/11/Screen-Shot-2021-11-03-at-12.01.10-PM.png)

### Secrets (Environment variables) in Replit

Replit no longer supports creating `.env` files.

![Image](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2021/11/Screen-Shot-2021-11-03-at-12.57.28-PM.png)
