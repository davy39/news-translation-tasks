If you want to improve your skills with Next.js, TailwindCSS, and MongoDB, we have a great project for you.

We just released a video course on the freeCodeCamp.org YouTube channel that will teach you how to build a modern ticketing app with Next.js, App Router, Tailwind CSS, MongoDB, and other technologies. Whether you're a beginner or an experienced developer, this course will equip you with the skills to develop web applications using the latest technologies. Jacob Lower created this course. Jacob is an experienced software engineer.

A ticketing application in software development is a centralized tool for developers to manage tasks, issues, and projects efficiently. It enables the creation, assignment, tracking, and collaboration on tickets representing specific work items. These tools enhance teamwork, integrate with development workflows, and streamline communication and project management.

Here are the key technologies you'll be using in this course:

1. **Next.js:** Next.js is a powerful and popular React framework that simplifies the process of building modern, server-rendered applications. It offers features like code splitting, routing, and server-side rendering out of the box, making it an excellent choice for creating robust web applications. Throughout the course, you'll learn how to harness the full potential of Next.js to build a feature-rich ticketing app.
2. **App Router:** App Router is the new routing solution introduced in Next.js. It provides a more intuitive and flexible way to handle navigation within your Next.js applications. You'll dive deep into App Router and discover how it simplifies route management, making your ticketing app's user experience seamless and responsive.
3. **Tailwind CSS:** Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS framework that allows you to rapidly build beautiful and responsive user interfaces. It's known for its simplicity and the ability to create complex designs with minimal effort. In this course, you'll leverage Tailwind CSS to style your ticketing app, giving it a sleek and modern look without writing extensive custom CSS.
4. **MongoDB Atlas:** A ticketing application needs a robust database, and MongoDB Atlas fits the bill perfectly. MongoDB Atlas is a fully managed, cloud-hosted database service that allows you to store and retrieve data with ease. You'll learn how to set up MongoDB Atlas, create collections, and perform CRUD operations to manage ticket data effectively.
5. **Mongoose:** Mongoose is an elegant Node.js library that simplifies working with MongoDB. It provides an object data modeling (ODM) framework, allowing you to define schemas and interact with MongoDB in a structured way. Throughout the course, you'll use Mongoose to connect your Next.js application to MongoDB Atlas, ensuring smooth data retrieval and storage.

This video course is designed to be accessible to all skill levels. By the end of the course, you'll have the knowledge and hands-on experience needed to create a modern ticketing application that stands out in the world of web development.
