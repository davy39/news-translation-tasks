Mobile app development lets you build applications that run on multiple platforms. Flutter is Google's UI toolkit for building applications for mobile, web, and desktop from a single codebase. Flutter apps are written in Dart, a statically typed, object-oriented language.

Modern mobile development requires understanding widgets, state management, navigation, and data storage. The ecosystem includes thousands of free packages that give you access to device sensors, cloud services, and more.

This tutorial covers Dart fundamentals, Flutter basics, and some data storage options. There are 20 programs that walk you through building mobile apps from scratch. It’s built around a group of annotated *code playbacks*.

Each playback shows how I built a program step-by-step. They include a built-in AI tutor if you have any questions that I didn't cover. For a quick demo of how code playbacks work, watch this short video:

You can access the free tutorial here: [https://playbackpress.com/books/flutterbook](https://playbackpress.com/books/flutterbook)

**Prerequisites**: This is not a general introduction to programming, so you’ll need some basic programming knowledge to follow along. If you understand variables, loops, functions, and classes in any language, you should be fine. If you need an introduction to programming, check out my other tutorials in [C++](https://playbackpress.com/books/cppbook) or [Python](https://playbackpress.com/books/pybook) on [Playback Press](https://playbackpress.com/books).

## **Get Started**

Start with the Dart chapter if you're new to the language. If you have JavaScript, Java, or C# experience, it should feel familiar. Then, move on to the Flutter playbacks. Work through the playbacks at your own pace.
