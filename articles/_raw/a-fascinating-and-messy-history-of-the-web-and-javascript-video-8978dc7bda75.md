The history of the web and JavaScript is truly fascinating. ?

So I created this 19-minute video to help web developers understand it and learn from it.

In summary, you’ll learn the following:

* What JavaScript, the DOM, and CSS are, and how they came about.
* What ECMAScript, W3C, and TC39 are, and how they came about.
* That the evolution of these technologies didn’t happen in straight lines. There will be periods of chaos, periods of stagnation, periods of innovation, and so on.
* Contrary to the myth that “startups innovate and big companies don’t do much”, big companies do innovate a lot. But they also have strategic interests. And history shows that big companies actually run the show.
* Don’t wed yourself to a framework or a library.
* **Standards are created to democratize innovations.** Understanding standards, and participating in things like W3C and TC39 help everyone.

Further, you’ll learn that although there is a lot going on in the JavaScript world, things will be better in the coming future:

1. Expect “standards” to emerge
2. Expect future tools to abstract away a complexities (like create-react-app did)
3. Expect “simpler” and “smaller” frameworks to emerge. They will be much simpler than React, Vue, and current leading frameworks!

Note that this talk mainly focuses on the perspective of the creators of browser and JavaScript itself. It doesn’t talk about evolution of servers or mobile technologies.
