What do you do while you eat breakfast in the morning?

I personally like to fire up a tech talk and sit back while an expert explains a new computer science concept to me.

There are hundreds of coding-related conferences around the world every year. And you can often hear insights about important projects through tech talks – straight from their founders and maintainers.

## The freeCodeCamp Talks YouTube Channel

The best place to find full-length tech talks is the freeCodeCamp Talks channel. We publish new talks by developers Monday through Friday.

Our nonprofit has partnered with PyCon and dozens of other tech conferences around the world to bring you awesome tech talks for free – right from the convenience of your phone or laptop.

You can work these talks into your daily routine. Or you can just Voltron them all together into your own mini tech conference, and binge-watch them over a weekend.

## What are these Tech Talks like? And what topics do they focus on?

Most of these are about 30 minutes long. Here are some of the topics we've published on:

* Functional Programming
* Penetration Testing
* Front End Development
* Python Libraries
* Web Assembly
* Robotics
* And a whole lot more.

## Sounds rad. Where can I subscribe to freeCodeCamp Talks?

You can [subscribe to this channel for free](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCVk8weS4S2kJfja72fTxh5A?sub_confirmation=1).

Also be sure to click the little “bell” to turn on notifications. YouTube will let you know when we post new videos.

Again, we plan to continue publishing new talks Monday through Friday each week. We already have 35 talks live, and we hope to eventually have thousands of talks.

Imagine a virtual Library of Alexandria overflowing with developer wisdom goodness. That's what we're aiming for.

If you yourself have given a tech talk at an event and would like for us to publish it and publicize it to the global freeCodeCamp community, be sure to [email Beau Carnes](mailto:beau@freecodecamp.org), who runs the Talks channel. He may be able to feature it.

## What about the original freeCodeCamp YouTube channel?

It’s still going strong!

We are publishing several videos each week there, including lots of full-length programming courses. You can [subscribe to it for free here](https://www.youtube.com/c/freecodecamp?sub_confirmation=1). (Again, be sure to ring the bell so YouTube will notify you when we publish new courses.)

Happy coding.
