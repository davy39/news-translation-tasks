If you’re just learning to code, one of the first things you need to do, after deciding what to learn, is choose a text editor for writing code.

A text editor is a program that helps you write plain text (without any formatting) and save it to a file. A good example is the Notepad editor on Windows.

As you start your coding journey, you will quickly discover that the text editor is where you’ll spend most of your time — since the fundamental job of any programmer is to write and edit source code. This is why it is necessary to pick one that works for you and supports your learning effort.

Not all text editors are great for programming, like the aforementioned Notepad, since it does nothing to ease or automate the editing of source code.

There are some text editors that are designed specifically for writing and editing source code. These are called code editors. A code editor maybe a standalone program or built into an Integrated Development Environment (IDE).

We also have code editors that live in the browser. [CodePen](https://codepen.io/), [Web Maker](https://webmakerapp.com/), and [Plunker](https://plnkr.co/) are prominent examples. You may already be familiar with some of these web-based editors, since many online coding programs like [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) recommend their use.

However, if you want to take your coding to the next level, you need to consider looking at a desktop editor which goes above and beyond the level of most web-based tools.

It’s easy to get overwhelmed when looking at the options out there as there are so many. Ask five people, and you’re likely to get five different answers.

If you’re just starting out, you need to choose an editor that supports you as a beginner. Learning to code is already hard enough, so you can use all the help you can get.

The goal of this article is to help you decide what text editor to use when learning to code with a specific emphasis on programming in JavaScript.

### What to look for in a Code Editor

All code editors can write text and save it to a file. Beyond that, the type of editor you choose is purely down to your personal preference. That said, there are a few things that your editor must have for it to be considered good enough for developing in JavaScript.

#### Syntax Highlighting

Literally all code editors support highlighting source code in different colors based on the language you’re working with. This improves readability, and helps you spot syntax errors much quicker.

#### Auto Completion

Code auto completion is a feature offered by many code editors that helps to accelerate the editing process and reduce typos by completing the names of variables, keywords, classes, and methods within the scope of your program.

If you’re just starting out, I recommend turning off auto complete in your editor and typing everything out manually instead, so that you can memorize the syntax much quicker.

However, once you’ve got a grip on all the basic keywords and built-in methods, I do not see much value in typing everything out by yourself. Auto complete becomes invaluable at this point.

#### Support for ES2015+ as well as popular frameworks and libraries

A good editor should also provide support for the latest JavaScript features soon after they are released, and have a strong plugin ecosystem so you can get support for the most popular frameworks and libraries.

With these considerations in mind, let’s look at a few options that you can use if you’re just getting started with JavaScript and web development in general.

To make it easier for you to pick one, I have ranked them from most recommended to least recommended. This ranking is subjective so I encourage you to draw your own conclusions after trying each one out.

All the editors listed here are cross-platform across Windows, macOS, and Linux so you don’t have to worry about compatibility with your favorite operating system.

### Visual Studio Code — Free

[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) (VS Code), not to be confused with [Visual Studio](https://www.visualstudio.com/), is the best text editor for JavaScript developers right now. Although it is relatively young compared to other popular editors, having just been released in 2015, it has improved in leaps and bounds over the years. So much so, in fact, that it was listed as the most popular text editor among web developers in the latest [Stack Overflow survey](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2018/#development-environments-and-tools).

VS Code is more than just a basic text editor. Some people say it is closer to an IDE than a text editor, since it provides many features that you will typically find in an IDE.

Some of its headline features include built-in debugging tools, intelligent code completion ([IntelliSense](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/intellisense)), an integrated terminal, and native support for many common Git operations. As a beginner, you can leverage these features to produce working code at a much faster rate.

Customizability is another area where Visual Studio Code shines. It supports thousands of plugins and themes which you can install to further enhance its capabilities.

### Sublime Text 3 — $80

[Sublime Text 3](https://www.sublimetext.com/) was the editor I first used when I was just learning to code, so I do have a soft spot for it. It’s a great editor that remains popular among web developers due to its simplicity and ease of use.

While its out of the box support for JavaScript is quite lame compared to VS Code, you can augment this by installing plugins. It’s also very fast and does not use a ton of memory — which is why I often recommend it for people whose computers have less than 4GB of RAM.

Although Sublime is pricey at $80 for a single user license, it can be downloaded and evaluated without cost. You only get a popup message from time to time reminding you to purchase a license for continued use.

### Atom — Free

[Atom](https://atom.io/) was introduced in 2014 by GitHub as a free and open source alternative to proprietary tools like Sublime Text and Text Mate. Although it gained a fervent following, it never reached Sublime’s levels of popularity and has now been surpassed by VS Code which was released a year later.

That’s not to say Atom is a bad editor — far from it. It’s approachable for beginners and doesn’t require any configuration to get started. Just like VS Code, it is also extensible through plugins and supports many IDE-like features which can increase your speed and efficiency when writing code.

### Vim — Free

[Vim is my current text editor of choice](https://freshman.tech/from-vscode-to-vim/) after various stints with other code editors. Although I use and love Vim, I would hesitate to recommend it for people who are just learning to code, because it has a completely different approach to editing text compared to other mainstream code editors. This means you have to invest time to learn how it works, which may distract you from actually learning to code.

If you’re busy learning to program, it’s better to use an interface you’re already familiar with so that you don’t get sidetracked from actual programming. Besides, Vim lacks many nice features that editors like VS Code or Atom provide by default. Although it is possible to add more functionality to Vim using plugins, the process for doing so is a bit more involved.

If you’ve already achieved a reasonable level of competency in the language you’re learning, and you’re interested in trying out Vim, you can take a leaf from how [Yehuda Katz was able to transition to Vim without losing productivity](http://yehudakatz.com/2010/07/29/everyone-who-tried-to-convince-me-to-use-vim-was-wrong/) and go from there.

### WebStorm — $129/year

[WebStorm](https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/) is another interesting option that many JavaScript developers swear by, although it’s a full-blown IDE and not just a text editor. It’s also the most expensive option that I know of, although you can [get it for free](https://www.jetbrains.com/student/) alongside other JetBrains products if you are are a student.

I haven’t had any personal experience with WebStorm, but most reviewers are quick to praise its deep support for JavaScript and its ecosystem, as you might expect from a sophisticated IDE. On the flip side, it has a steeper learning curve than standalone text editors and lots of features that you don’t really need as a beginner.

I think WebStorm could be a great tool to learn when you have a bit more experience, but I see no reason to start with it.

### There are no wrong choices

Whichever of these editors you choose is great. All of them make good environments for writing JavaScript, so it’s really not a problem if you decide not go with the top pick in favor of something else.

What I would caution against is spending too much time learning complicated tools like Vim or WebStorm. As a beginner, you should focus more on programming itself — which is why I’ve listed Visual Studio Code, Sublime Text, and Atom as my top picks, as they’re all welcoming for newbies. I suggest you try out all three and pick the one you’re most comfortable with.
