Eleftheria Batsou is a web developer from Thessaloniki, Greece. She gave a talk at the Codegarden conference about her experience doing a solid 100 days of coding every day as part of the #100DaysOfCode Challenge.

In her talk, Eleftheria talks about “scaling yourself.” She shows some of the 50 illustrations she built using pure CSS, and shows some of the browser-based video games she built.

She also gives helpful tips on:

* staying motivated
* managing your time
* finding a mentor
* fighting procrastination
* staying organized
* and balancing your career against your personal life
