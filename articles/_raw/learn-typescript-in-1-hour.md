TypeScript is a powerful, statically-typed superset of JavaScript that helps you write safer and more maintainable code.

We just posted a course on the freeCodeCamp.org YouTube channel that will help you master the essentials of TypeScript. In just one hour, you’ll learn everything from basic types and annotations to advanced features like generics and interfaces. The course walks through practical examples, helping you understand how TypeScript can make your code more robust, maintainable, and error-free.

Each section is structured to build your knowledge step by step, so you can follow along and code in real time. By the end, you’ll have a solid foundation in TypeScript and the confidence to use it in your own projects. Muhammad Omar Al Najjar created this course.
