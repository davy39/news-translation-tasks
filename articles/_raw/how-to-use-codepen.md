[CodePen](https://codepen.io/) is a popular online code editor used by many developers around the world. It is also one of the recommended editors you can use for the [freeCodeCamp curriculum.](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn)

CodePen is only for frontend projects and supports HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. If you need to build a project with a backend component, then you will need to use a different editor. 

In this article, I will discuss the following:

## How to sign up for a free account

When you visit the [CodePen](https://codepen.io) website, you will be able to login with the following options:

* Twitter account
* Facebook account
* GitHub account

You can also signup with an email address where you will create a username and password. 

Once you create the account, you should receive an email from CodePen. Open up that message and verify your email address.

## Differences between Pens and Projects

### Pens

After verifying your email address, you should be taken straight to the Pen editor. If the editor does not show up, then you can click on Pen located on the left hand side of the homepage.

A Pen editor is broken up into three sections of HTML, CSS and JavaScript. 

![Image](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2021/03/pen-editor.png)

This editor does not support multiple HTML, CSS and JavaScript files. Pens are great for smaller scale creations.  

If you are looking to write more than 5,000 lines of code then you should consider a project instead. 

With the free account, you can have as many Pens as you like. 

### Projects

If you want to create a project, then click on Project, which is located at the top left hand corner of the home page. 

![Image](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-29-at-11.50.29-PM.png)

A project editor supports multiple HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files. 

![Image](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2021/03/project-editor.png)

With the free account, you can only have one project and 10 files. If you are interested in creating more projects, you will need to upgrade to the Pro account.  

## Basic Features of the Pen Editor

### Formatting Options

If you click on the dropdown arrow on any of the three editors, you will see an option to format your code. 

This is a helpful tool to ensure that your code is properly formatted and readable by other developers.

This is a tool that will help you find and fix errors in your code.

### Adding links for the head section (HTML)

When you are creating your Pens, you do not have to include the `DOCTYPE`, `html`, `head`, or `body` tags. All of that information is already built into the editor.

If you need to add links for the head section such as Font Awesome icons or Google Fonts, then you can add those in the head section of the HTML settings.

CodePen has an option in the settings to add CSS libraries and frameworks to your Pens. Some of the libraries and frameworks include Bootstrap, Tailwind CSS, and Bulma.

First go to the Pen you are interested in forking. Then click on the fork button located at the bottom right hand corner.
