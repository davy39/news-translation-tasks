## Learn about programmer history while you play classic card games like Poker, Blackjack, and Solitaire

I'm thrilled to announce that freeCodeCamp's Programmer Playing Cards are now printed and ready to ship! We've printed 1,000 limited edition decks on 100% PVC card stock. 

We're shipping about 200 of these to community supporters who requested them back in December. And you can [buy one of the remaining decks here](https://freecodecamp.typeform.com/to/a08zoC).

Here's a 3-minute video of me demo'ing the cards, along with freeCodeCamp Study Group Leader Chris Tse:

## How the Programmer Playing Cards work

This is an ultra-high quality deck of 54 100% PVC playing cards.

While you’re playing, you can marvel at the accomplishments of these programmers who pioneered the techniques and technologies modern programmers depend upon today.

Each card contains the programmer’s photo, a list of their major accomplishments, and a fun quotation from them.

The cards are ordered by the programmer’s date of birth, with earlier programmers occupying the Aces and Kings of each suit, and newer programmers filling out the 3s and 2s.

All the greats are in here — from history’s first programmer, Ada Lovelace, on down to more contemporary programmers, like blockchain inventor Satoshi Nakamoto.

There have been so many great programmers throughout history, it was hard to decide on just 54 of them. But freeCodeCamp editor [Abigail Rennemeyer](https://twitter.com/abbeyrenn) and I put together a list of candidates.

We chose good creative-commons licensed photos of each programmer, decided which achievements we wanted to highlight, then dug through interviews to find their choicest quotes.

Then freeCodeCamp contributor [Phoenix Abhishek](https://github.com/PhoeniXAbhisheK) laid these cards out in a clean, minimalist design, and a crisp monospace font.

When you use Programmer Playing Cards, you and your friends will get tons of exposure to these programmer greats. Just by seeing their names and faces over and over as you play, you’ll come to know and appreciate many of the highlights of programming history.

### These aren’t your grandpa’s paper playing cards.

These aren’t just any playing cards — we printed them on 100% polyvinyl carbonate, a flexible polymer more commonly known as PVC.

A lot of the professional card players prefer playing with PVC cards, and a lot of magicians prefer them, too.

Why? Because PVC is much heavier — the 54 card deck weighs 166 grams (6 ounces).

PVC cards are also a lot more durable. You can bend them in half, or wash them in the sink if you get barbecue sauce on them.

I even tried (unsuccessfully) to burn one using a lighter.

Here’s a video from a few months ago of me demonstrating the build quality and durability of these cards:
