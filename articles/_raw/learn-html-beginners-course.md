HTML is the backbone of every website on the internet. If you want to get into web development, learning HTML is the place to start.

We just published a beginner's HTML video course on the freeCodeCamp.org YouTube channel. (And we still offer our [free interactive HTML course](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/responsive-web-design/).)

Dave Gray created this course. Dave is a university instructor, course creator, and excellent teacher.

This full HTML5 course is a great place to begin your journey towards learning web development. Think of this course like a video textbook with 10 clearly defined chapters.
