Project 3 from JavaScript Algos and DS Certification.

We're continuing our journey through the FreeCodeCamp JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures Certification! Last project was the **Roman Numeral Converter**, the second entry in our series. You can [check it out here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_ISxHcg-RM).

Now we're doing the **Caesars Cipher**. Our job is to take a ROT13-encoded string and return it as a decoded string.

This video covers:

* What Caesar Ciphers are
* What ROT13 Ciphers are
* How to encode and decode strings using ciphers
* What accumulators are (useful for later JavaScript)
* An efficient solution with linear runtime O(n)
* and more!

You can watch [the full video on my YouTube channel](https://youtu.be/_AJ7vx8yRDg).

Here's a link to [the entire playlist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XV5OCibNpLI&list=PLehRZjGCVhQLTWPN8mTo3rlRDQff9fCmT) as well.
