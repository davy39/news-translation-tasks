Go is a powerful programming language that is quickly growing in popularity. It's easy to learn and works great for building powerful applications. Whether you're new to coding or already know other programming languages, Go is a great choice for expanding your skills.

We just published a course on the [freeCodeCamp.org Spanish YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/freecodecampespanol) that will teach you the basics of Go step by step. You will start by installing and configuring Go and gradually dive into more advanced topics, including data types, variables, conditionals, loops, functions, the Go standard library, and much more.

If you have Spanish-speaking friends, you are welcome to share the [**Spanish version of this article**](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/aprende-go-curso-de-golang-desde-cero) with them.

The course was created by Leonardo José Castillo Lacruz. Leonardo is a software developer and content creator who loves teaching programming and sharing his knowledge.

Are you ready? Let's see a quick overview of Go and what you will learn in the course.

# Golang for Beginners

In the constantly-evolving world of software development, choosing and learning the right programming language is essential. Go (also known as Golang) has become a powerful and versatile option, rapidly gaining popularity for its combination of simplicity, efficiency, and scalability.

Key advantages of Go include:

* It's easy to learn and understand because of its simple syntax.
    
* It's very fast because it is [compiled ahead of time into native machine code](https://go.dev/doc/faq).
    
* It has powerful tools to handle concurrent tasks.
    
* It's an open source programming language supported by Google.
    
* It has [use cases](https://go.dev/solutions/use-cases) in various industries, including cloud and network services, command-line interfaces, web development, and development operations and site reliability engineering.
    

And more!

Go is a beginner-friendly programming language, so both new and experienced developers can start building amazing applications with its capabilities.

💡 **Tip:** If you are curious, Go's mascot is this beautiful [Gopher](https://go.dev/blog/gopher) that we have below. (Another reason to learn and love Go, right? 😁).
