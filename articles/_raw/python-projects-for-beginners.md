The best way to learn a new programming language is to build projects with it.

I have created a list of 25 beginner friendly project tutorials in Python.

My advice for tutorials would be to watch the video, build the project, break it apart and rebuild it your own way. Experiment with adding new features or using different methods.

That will test if you have really learned the concepts or not.

You can click on any of the projects listed below to jump to that section of the article.

If you are not familiar with the basics of Python, then I would suggest watching [this beginner freeCodeCamp Python tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfscVS0vtbw).
