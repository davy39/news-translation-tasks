You might have heard of a CSV file but what does it mean? 

In this article, we are going to learn what a CSV file is, and how to open and export them using Microsoft Excel and Google Sheets. 

## What is a CSV file? 

CSV stands for Comma Separated Values. This is a file that contains data separated by commas and is usually used in spreadsheets and databases. 

This is an example of a CSV file. We have two categories of Full Name and Major and the data is separated by commas. 

```txt
Full Name,Major
Dave Wilson,Computer Science Major
Kelly Clarks,Music Major
James Anderson,Business Major
```

Sometimes the separation of the data doesn't have to be a comma. It could be a space or semicolon.

This separator is called a delimiter but the most commonly used is a comma. 

CSV files are very useful because you can share information between different programs as long as they can open up the file. 

For example, I can create a CSV file in Microsoft Excel and import that data into my contacts.
