Job interviews are stressful for many people. Besides the pressure of getting hired, you have to answer various questions before and during the interview – like what to wear, how to get prepared, how much money to ask for, and much more.

As a Front-end Developer, I’ve been on over **30 job interviews** in the last 5 years, from startups to global companies, and even in different countries. I’ve learned a few things, and in this article I would like to share some of the most important **(non-technical) tips** to remember to help you have a successful interview and find your dream job.

## 1. Define Your Expectations

Let's start talking about what to do before the interview process. Before having an interview, it is important to know what to expect from that company/project. Everyone has different expectations and so do employers. If they match yours, then you'll probably get hired and take the job.

Before applying, reading the job advertisement carefully helps to see whether it meets your requirements or not. Some questions to clarify could be:

* The details of the position (web development, mobile app development, etc.)
* The size of the company (start-ups, mid-size, global)
* Whether traveling is required or not
* What projects the company works on
* Which technologies they are using
* What level of experience they are looking for

Maybe not all of these things are explained in the job advertisement, so this will help you know what to ask your potential employer during the interview.

## 2. Ask for help from your friends

Your friends can help you find a job. If you have a friend who is already working in a company, it's a good idea to ask them whether there is a suitable position in their company. 

You can also get some information from your friend about the company and decide whether it suits you.

> Some companies are more likely to hire their employees' friends as co-workers.

## 3. Try to relax

OK, you've prepared your CV, you've sent out your applications, and now you have an interview. It's normal to get nervous before the interview but that doesn't really help. A calm candidate seems more **professional** and **self-confident.**

Here are some suggestions that will help you to feel relaxed before the interview:

* Like I've mentioned before, do some research about the position and the company, and get prepared
* Arrive a bit early so you have time to breathe
* Think positive, focus on your strong skills
* Remember that an interview is nothing more than a conversation
* Enter the interview knowing that (if things go wrong) there are always other opportunities in the market

## 4. Have an online profile for coding

In some interviews, you will be asked whether you can show your coding skills. In today’s world, everyone has a **[social media profile](https://twitter.com/cem_eygi)**. So why not also have a profile for business? (which is coding for us)

For example, you can have a:

* Github account - you can upload your example projects there
* Blog Website - you can write about different tech you know
* [Youtube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC1EgYPCvKCXFn8HlpoJwY3Q?view_as=subscriber) - you can make tutorial videos to share with the community

Even having 1 of these things will make an outstanding difference.

## 5. Ask & Answer questions with honesty

**Honesty is important.** Let your potential employer understand who you really are, what you really know, and what you expect from the job.

On the other hand, you should also ask as many questions as possible. This is a good sign that shows to your employer that you're interested in the job.

It's important to remember that most of our time passes in our day jobs. We don't really want to work somewhere we don't like. Sure, it's always possible to change our jobs later but we should focus first on staying longer.

## 6. Comment carefully about your previous employers

Another important point is to talk carefully about your former employers/companies. You will probably receive a question like this: **“What are the reasons that you want to change your job?”** or this: **“Why did you leave the company XYZ?”**

Sure, everyone has their own good reasons for a job change. But while explaining your reasons, keep it within professional and respectful borders. Whatever the reason is, your potential employer shouldn’t think that you’re complaining about everything. And if they hire you, you will probably also do the same with their company.

## 7. Know your market's salary range

Companies mostly ask your salary expectations on the application form. Make sure that you know the **market range in your local region**, so you can know how much to ask for.

For example, if the market range is between $40,000 — $60,000 yearly annual, and if you ask for a $100,000, you're not gonna get the job unless you’re Bill Gates. (But hey, then you start your own business :))

So you should know what your local market range is and you can ask for something between, depending on your experience. And remember – it’s better not to talk about money until they ask.

## Last but not least, don’t be late!

The more interviews you have, the better you become. It's all about the experience. Getting hired is not easy. Sometimes you'll only have 2, maybe 3 interviews. There are also technical interviews, which I will talk about later in another post.

I hope those tips I’ve mentioned help you in your upcoming interviews. I wish you all good luck and a better career.
