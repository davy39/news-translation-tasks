Unreal Engine is one of the most popular tools for creating 3D and 2D games. Blueprint visual scripting system for gameplay that makes creating games even easier.

We've released a free course on the freeCodeCamp.org YouTube channel that will show you how to create a 2.5D platformer game with Unreal Engine and Blueprints. The course was developed by Awesome Tuts.

You will learn how to make a ball move around, collect energy points, lose health, interact with the environment and items, and more. The game will act as a template that you can build upon and add your own features.

You are provided 3d assets to use in the game. These assets can be used for this game and for other games that you create.

This is a great overall tutorial if you want to improve your game development skills.

You can watch the full course on [the freeCodeCamp.org YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Fd9hw329fY) (3 hour watch).
