A lot of beginners can become intimidated when they're learning how to code. But learning through coding games can be fun and educational. 

According to [True Education Partnerships](https://www.trueeducationpartnerships.com/schools/gamification-in-education/), 

> **Gamification in learning** involves using game-based elements such as point scoring, peer competition, team work, and score tables to drive engagement, help students assimilate new information and test their knowledge.

I have curated a list of 12 coding games for beginners. 

Here is the complete list. Once you find a website that interests you, click that link and it will jump you down to a more detailed description of that website.
