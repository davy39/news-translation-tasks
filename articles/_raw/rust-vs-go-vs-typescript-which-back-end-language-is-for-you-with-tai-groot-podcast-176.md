On this week's episode of the podcast, freeCodeCamp founder Quincy Larson interviews Tai Groot. He's a back end software engineer and maintains an open source project used by companies like Google.

For the first half of the interview we talk about back end programming languages. Then he shares tips for running learning back end development and running your own developer consultancy.

We talk about:

* The Performance VS Developer Experience trade-offs of Rust, Go, and TypeScript
    
* How to run a free open source project profitably
    
* How to mentor junior devs and ramp them up to work at your consultancy
    
* Why he recommends devs learn Arch Linux
