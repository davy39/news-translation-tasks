Large Language Models (LLMs) can be super helpful for advanced data analysis.

We just published a new course on the freeCodeCamp.org YouTube channel that will teach you all about multimodal data analysis using LLMs and Python. This course will teach you how to leverage LLMs to perform sophisticated, multimodal data analysis with just a few lines of Python code.

This comprehensive tutorial was developed by Dr. Immanuel Trummer, an associate professor at Cornell University. It offers a deep dive into the cutting-edge techniques of analyzing various types of data using state-of-the-art language models.

Here are some of the key topics covered in the course:

1. Text Classification with LLMs: Learn how to leverage the power of language models to classify text data efficiently and accurately.
    
2. Image Analysis: Discover techniques for answering questions about images, opening up new possibilities for visual data interpretation.
    
3. Audio Data Processing: Master the art of transcribing speech to text, enabling you to work with audio data in new and innovative ways.
    
4. Natural Language Querying of Databases: Build a natural language query interface for SQL databases, making data exploration more intuitive and accessible.
    

And here are some of the things that make this course stand out:

* Hands-on Learning: The course provides practical, code-based examples that you can follow along with and adapt to your own projects.
    
* Multimodal Approach: By covering text, image, and audio data, the course prepares you for a wide range of real-world data analysis scenarios.
    
* Expert Instruction: Benefit from the knowledge and experience of Dr. Trummer, a respected researcher and educator in the field of data management and LLMs.
    
* Comprehensive Resources: Access to a wealth of supporting materials, including code samples, datasets, and additional learning resources.
    

This course is perfect for data scientists, machine learning engineers, and anyone interested in pushing the boundaries of what's possible with LLMs and data analysis. Whether you're looking to enhance your current skillset or pivot into the exciting field of AI-powered data analysis, this tutorial provides a solid foundation and practical skills you can apply immediately.
