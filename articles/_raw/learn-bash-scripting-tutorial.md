Bash scripting is an essential skill for any developer, system administrator, or power user who wants to automate repetitive tasks and make their workflow more efficient.

We just published a bash scripting for beginners course on the freeCodeCamp.org YouTube channel. Herbert from Herbertech created this course.

In this course, you'll learn the basics of bash scripting, including how to use basic commands, write your first bash script, and use variables and positional arguments. You'll also learn about output and input redirection, test operators, if/elif/else statements, case statements, arrays, for loops, functions, and exit codes.

By the end of the course, you'll have a solid understanding of how to use bash scripting to automate tasks and streamline your workflow. You'll be able to write scripts that can perform complex operations, manipulate text files using AWK and SED, and handle errors using exit codes.

This course is perfect for beginners who are new to bash scripting or want to refresh their knowledge. The instructor has a wealth of experience in teaching programming and web development, and his teaching style is clear, concise, and easy to follow.

Whether you're a developer looking to automate tasks, a system administrator managing a server, or a power user looking to make your workflow more efficient, this course is an excellent way to get started with bash scripting.
