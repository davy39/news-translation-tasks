Asking for help on a forum is a great way to learn and grow as a developer. But it is important that you know how to ask good questions so people can effectively help you. 

In this article, I will walk you through how to ask good questions on a forum so you can receive helpful answers. 

## Make sure to research the problem first

freeCodeCamp has come up with the [Read - Search - Ask method](https://forum.freecodecamp.org/t/how-to-get-help-when-you-are-stuck-coding/19514). Before you make a post on the forum, make sure to read through the error messages you are receiving. 

Then you can search through documentation or Google to see if there is a solution you can use to help you. If you have questions about specific methods or properties make sure to look at documentation first. 

Please avoid making posts like this:

This question is vague and can be easily searched for on Google.

If you have specific questions on how a method works, then you need to make sure to detail that in your post. 

## Ask specific questions and provide details of the problem

When you need help with a problem, please provide as much detail as possible so people know how to help you. 

You want to avoid making posts like this:

This post does not provide any explanation of what the user is struggling with which makes it hard for people to offer assistance. 

If you are struggling with a problem, make sure to include the following:

* a descriptive title related to the problem you are facing
* a brief description of the problem you are facing
* a list of error messages you are seeing
* a link to the challenge or project you are working on
* your code of what you have tried so far

### Example of specific forum question

Now let's look at an example of how to ask a more specific question. The title of the below post is "Having trouble creating a responsive image for the tribute page project".

That descriptive title lets people know what I am struggling with. In the body of my post, I am going to describe the problem and provide all of the necessary information.

In this post, I have included the full project code, a description of the problem, a code snippet of what I tried and the error messages I am receiving.

I also let people know I tried researching for the problem first. 

With this type of information, someone can go into my project code and realize that I mistakenly wrote `.img-div` instead of `#img-div`. 

## Remember to format your code 

When providing code snippets in your post, please remember to format your code so people can read it. 

Please read through [this post](https://forum.freecodecamp.org/t/forum-code-formatting/25574) on how to format your code in a forum. 

If you need help formatting your code, then please reach out to a moderator for that forum and they will assist you. 

## Conclusion

It is important to remember that people want to help you. But if you don't provide enough information, then it makes it difficult to assist you.

I hope you found this article helpful, and happy coding.
