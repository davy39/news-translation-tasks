On today's episode, I interview Dylan Israel. Dylan is a software engineer, a YouTuber, and the creator of several programming courses.

We talk about how he dropped out of college, drove from California to Florida, and hustled to get his first developer job. We also talk about how important his YouTube channel has been in helping him land job offers.

And Dylan shares some details about his latest job search, which resulted in 4 job offers. Dylan was ultimately able to use those job offers a bargaining chip so he could a massive raise at his current company without having to change jobs.
