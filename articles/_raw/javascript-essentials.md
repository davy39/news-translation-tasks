JavaScript is the backbone of modern web development, powering everything from interactive websites to complex web applications. Object-oriented programming (OOP), prototypical inheritance, ES6 classes, Node.js, and asynchronous programming are all key areas that can take your JavaScript skills to the next level.

We just published a course on the freeCodeCamp.org YouTube channel that will teach you all about JavaScript essentials, from the fundamentals of OOP to advanced asynchronous techniques. Taught by Steven Garcia, this comprehensive course covers a wide range of JavaScript topics, including object creation, inheritance, ES6 features, Node.js, and handling asynchronous code effectively. Whether you're interested in learning about JavaScript’s prototypical inheritance, ES6 classes, or how Node.js modules work, this course provides structured, hands-on learning that will help you become a more confident JavaScript developer.

### What You'll Learn in This Course:

#### 1\. Object-Oriented Programming in JavaScript

* Learn about the four pillars of OOP: Encapsulation, Abstraction, Inheritance, and Polymorphism.
    
* Understand JavaScript’s approach to OOP using object literals, constructors, and factory functions.
    
* Explore private properties and methods using Getters and Setters.
    

#### 2\. Prototypical Inheritance and ES6 Classes

* Discover how prototypes work in JavaScript and why inheritance is different compared to classical OOP languages.
    
* Learn about constructor prototypes, prototype members, and method overriding.
    
* Explore ES6 classes, including static methods, private members, and inheritance.
    

#### 3\. Node.js and Package Management

* Understand how Node.js works, its architecture, and how it manages modules.
    
* Learn to work with Node’s built-in modules, such as the File System and Events modules.
    
* Master NPM (Node Package Manager) to install, update, and publish packages.
    

#### 4\. Asynchronous JavaScript

* Grasp the differences between synchronous and asynchronous code.
    
* Learn how to handle async operations using callbacks, promises, and async/await.
    
* Discover techniques to write clean and efficient asynchronous JavaScript.
    

This course is ideal for anyone who wants to deepen their JavaScript knowledge and gain practical experience with modern development tools and techniques. Whether you’re working on frontend or backend development, understanding JavaScript’s advanced features will make you a more versatile and capable developer.
