The freeCodeCamp community just published our new [B1 English for Developers certification](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/b1-english-for-developers/) for intermediate learners of English as a second language. You can now sit for the exam to earn the free verified certification, which you can add to your résumé, CV, or LinkedIn profile.

## How Does the B1 English for Developers Certification Work?

This Intermediate level English for Developers Curriculum will help you strengthen the foundational skills developed in the [A2 English for developers certification](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/a2-english-for-developers/) while introducing more complex grammar and expanding on work-related topics.

This entire curriculum will follow the B1 level of the Common European Framework of Reference (CEFR). And, as always, we've focused on vocabulary that is particularly useful for developers.

You'll learn how to describe places and things, share past experiences, and confidently use tenses like Present Perfect and Future. Practical communication strategies are included as well, such as managing conversations, expressing opinions, and building agreement or disagreement in discussions.

A “Start project” button appears below, followed by a section called “Dialogue 1: The Latest User Feedback” with a numbered grid of lesson steps from 1 to 41.](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1765908306493/fe7a163a-3e60-4a75-8700-482f59c01474.png align="center")

You'll also practice vocabulary and phrases essential for developers, such as describing code, participating in meetings, and discussing tech trends. Advanced topics include conditionals, comparative structures, and conversation management, so you can prepare for more complex interactions.

This entire B1-level curriculum includes **73 different dialogues** recorded by native English speakers. Each section follows a unique theme, contains several dialogues, and is filled with hundreds of interactive tasks that will help you develop your English skills.

These tasks will introduce new vocabulary, teach grammar, or review concepts that you’ll need to know in order to understand what the characters from the dialogues are saying. Each task will have an accompanying question that will help you practice the content.

The curriculum also has fill-in-the-blank questions that will help you practice writing in English.

Once you’ve completed the certification, you’ll be able to take the B1 English for Developers exam. This exam contains 54 grammar questions, 24 listening questions, and 9 reading questions. All the questions are based on what’s covered in the certification course.

You can take the exam by using our new open source exam environment. The freeCodeCamp community designed this exam environment tool with two goals in mind: respecting your privacy while also making it harder for people to cheat.

Once you download the app to your laptop or desktop, you can take the exam.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Is all of this really free?

Yes. freeCodeCamp has always been free, and we’ve now offered free verified certifications for more than a decade. These exams are just the latest expansion to our community’s free learning resources.

### Can I study the certification courses in languages other than English?

We aim to make every course available in all supported languages on freeCodeCamp. Check your account settings to see if the course you are studying is already offered in your preferred language.

### What language skills does the curriculum cover?

The languages courses currently cover listening, reading, and writing. We have plans to add speaking later on.

### Are the audio in the language courses and exams recorded by native language speakers?

Yes. All the audios present in the language courses were recorded by native speakers of that language.

### I am Deaf or hard of hearing. Can I still study the language courses?

Yes! All audio lesson have closed captions and transcripts available for reading.

### I am blind or have limited vision, and use a screen reader. Can I still study the language courses?

Yes! freeCodeCamp courses are designed to be accessible, and you can study the language courses using a screen reader. If you run into any accessibility issues, you can report them on our GitHub repository so the community can address them.

### What are the letters and numbers beside the certification name? (For example: A1, A2, B1)

These labels refer to the CEFR levels, which is an international framework used to describe language proficiency. A1 and A2 represent beginner levels, B1 and B2 represent intermediate levels, and C1 and C2 represent advanced levels.

![Graphic titled “CEFR Levels Explained” showing the six CEFR language proficiency levels from A1 to C2. A1 is described as communicating with help from the listener. A2 involves communicating in a limited range of contexts. B1 focuses on communicating essential points in familiar contexts. B2 involves communicating with some fluency in a range of contexts. C1 emphasizes flexible and fluent communication in many contexts. C2 represents precise and sensitive communication in most contexts. The freeCodeCamp logo appears at the bottom.](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1765475620837/6822cf7c-d05f-4a5c-8e8a-994c540ed369.png align="center")

Each level indicates the skills and knowledge you are expected to have at that stage of your language learning journey.

### What prevents people from just cheating on the exams?

Our goal is to strike a balance between preventing cheating and respecting people's right to privacy.

We've implemented a number of reliable, yet non-invasive, measures to help prevent people from cheating on freeCodeCamp's exams:

1. For each exam, we have a massive bank of questions and potential answers to those questions. Each time a person attempts an exam, they'll see only a small, randomized sampling of these questions.
    
2. We only allow people to attempt an exam one time per week. This reduces their ability to "brute force" the exam.
    
3. We have security in place to validate exam submissions and prevent man-in-the-middle attacks or manipulation of the exam environment.
    
4. We manually review each passing exam for evidence of cheating. Our exam environment produces tons of metrics for us to draw from.
    

We take cheating, and any form of academic dishonesty, seriously. We will act decisively.

This said, no one's exam results will be thrown out without human review, and no one's account will be banned without warning based on a single suspicious exam result.

### Are these exams “open book” or “closed book”?

All of freeCodeCamp’s exams are “closed book”, meaning you must rely only on your mind and not outside resources.

Of course, in the real world you’ll be able to look things up. And in the real world, we encourage you to do so.

But that is not what these exams are evaluating. These exams are instead designed to test your memory of details and your comprehension of concepts.

So when taking these exams, do not use outside assistance in the form of books, notes, AI tools, or other people. Use of any of these will be considered academic dishonesty.

### Do you record my webcam, microphone, or require me to upload a photo of my personal ID?

No. We considered adding these as additional test-taking security measures. But we have less privacy-invading methods of detecting most forms of academic dishonesty.

### If the environment is open source, doesn't that make it less secure?

"Given enough eyeballs, all bugs are shallow." – Linus’s Law, formulated by Eric S. Raymond in his book *The Cathedral and the Bazaar*

Open source software projects are often more secure than their closed source equivalents. This is because a lot more people are scrutinizing the code. And a lot more people can potentially help identify bugs and other deficiencies, then fix them.

We feel confident that open source is the way to go for this exam environment system.

### How can I contribute to the Exam Environment codebase?

It's fully open source, and we'd welcome your code contributions. Please read our general [contributor onboarding documentation](https://contribute.freecodecamp.org/intro/).

Then check out the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/exam-env).

You can help by creating issues to report bugs or request features.

You can also browse open `help wanted` issues and attempt to open pull requests addressing them.

### Are the exam questions themselves open source?

For obvious exam security reasons, the exam question banks themselves are not publicly accessible. :)

These are built and maintained by freeCodeCamp's staff instructional designers.

### What happens if I have internet connectivity issues mid-exam?

If you have internet connectivity issues mid exam, the next time you try to submit an answer, you’ll be told there are connectivity issues. The system will keep prompting you to retry submitting until the connection succeeds.

### What if my computer crashes mid-exam?

If your computer crashes mid exam, you’ll be able to re-open the Exam Environment. Then, if you still have time left for your exam attempt, you’ll be able to continue from where you left off.

### Can I take exams in languages other than English?

Not yet. We’re working to add multi-lingual support in the future.

### I have completed my exam. Why can't I see my results yet?

All exam attempts are reviewed by freeCodeCamp staff before we release the results. We do this to ensure the integrity of the exam process and to prevent cheating. Once your attempt has been reviewed, you'll be notified of your results the next time you log in to freeCodeCamp.org.

### I use a keyboard instead of a mouse. Can I navigate the exams using just a keyboard?

This is a high priority for us. We hope to add keyboard navigation to the Exam Environment app soon.

### Are exams timed?

Yes, exams are timed. We err on the side of giving plenty of time to take the exam, to account for people who are non-native English speakers, or who have ADHD and other learning differences that can make timed exams more challenging.

If you have a condition that usually qualifies you for extra time on standardized exams, please email support@freecodecamp.org. We’ll review your request and see whether we can find a reasonable solution.

### What happens if I fail the exam? Can I retake it?

Yes. You get one exam attempt per week. Afterward, if you don’t pass, there is a one-week (exactly 168 hour) “cool-down” period where you cannot take any freeCodeCamp exams. This is to encourage you to study and to pace yourself.

There is no limit to the number of times you can take an exam. So if you fail, study more, practice your skills more, then try again the following week.

### Will the exam be available to take on my phone?

At this time, no. You’ll need to use a laptop or desktop to download the exam environment and take the exam. We hope to eventually offer these certification exams on iPhone and Android.

### I have a disability or health condition that is not covered here. How can I request accommodations?

If you need specific accommodations for the exam (for example extra time, breaks, or alternative formats), please email support@freecodecamp.org. We’ll review your request and see whether we can find a reasonable solution.

## Anything else?

Good luck working through freeCodeCamp’s languages coursework and preparing for the exam.

Happy learning!
