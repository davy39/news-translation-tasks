Working with the canvas in [Unity 2D](https://unity.com/) can feel complicated at first, particularly if you're attempting to learn the editor while also tackling C# scripting.

It can also be daunting to think about turning a single-player game into a multiplayer experience, as there are a lot of new concepts to consider and several third-party packages from which to choose.

In Part 1 of this new video series, we'll create a basic 2D card game in Unity with randomized decks and draggable/droppable cards using the canvas, C# scripting, prefabs, and more (1 hour 10 minute watch):

In Part 2, we'll continue the adventure by cleaning up our nested canvas prefabs and enabling a mouseover card preview (42 minute watch):

In Part 3, we'll add basic multiplayer functionality with [Mirror](https://mirror-networking.com/) (1 hour 26 minute watch):

In Part 4, we'll continue to work with Mirror to improve our multiplayer experience (36 minute watch):

In Part 5, we'll add game logic from one of my games, _[Entromancy: Hacker Battles](https://www.nightpathpub.com/hacker-battles)_, to our multiplayer project (2 hour 34 minute watch):
