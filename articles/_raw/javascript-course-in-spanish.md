JavaScript is one of the most popular programming languages out there, and it's essential for web development. Learning JavaScript can be your next step into this amazing world of web dev.

We just published a course on the [freeCodeCamp.org Spanish YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/freecodecampespanol) that will teach you JavaScript from the fundamentals to the more advanced concepts. You'll also learn everything you'll need to get started with frameworks and libraries like React.js and Vue.js.

If you have Spanish-speaking friends, you are welcome to share the **[Spanish version of this article](https://www.freecodecamp.org/espanol/news/curso-de-javascript-desde-cero-aprende-javascript/)** with them.

This course was created by Carlos Azaustre. Carlos is a Telematics Engineer with more than 10 years of experience working as a Software Engineer and Developer Relations at companies like Google, IBM Research, and Eventbrite.

## **What is JavaScript?**

JavaScript is one of the most widely used programming languages because it is a building-block of the interactive web that we know today. It is used for developing interactive websites, web servers, mobile applications, games, and more. 

With JavaScript, the possibilities are endless. 

What makes JavaScript so powerful is its ability to manipulate the DOM (Document Object Model), the structure of web pages. With JavaScript, you can add, modify, and remove the elements of a web page and create the interactive behavior that makes the web so powerful today.

Without JavaScript, the web would just be a set of static web pages, showing the same content all the time. If you cannot imagine a world without the interactive web, you cannot image a world without JavaScript.

JavaScript was originally intended to be used for the web. It was designed to run in the browser, so by default, browsers can understand and interpret JavaScript code. 

With modern tools like Node.js, now we can also run our code in the terminal. This is very powerful and used very frequently by developers.

### Career Opportunities

If you learn JavaScript, you will find career opportunities in almost every field of your choice. JavaScript skills are in high demand and widely sought by employers.

### Libraries and Frameworks

In addition, there is a vast array of libraries and frameworks based on JavaScript, including: 

* React.js
* React Native
* Vue.js
* Angular.js
* Next.js

These are just some of the most popular ones. Each one has its own unique applications, but they are so diverse that I'm sure that you can find a JavaScript library that fits your needs.
