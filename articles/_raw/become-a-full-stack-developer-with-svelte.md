Full stack web development includes the backend that happens on a server and the frontend that happens on a web browser. New tools are making it easier than ever to create a full stack web app.

We just published a full stack web development course on the freeCodeCamp.org YouTube channel. And the best part: it can all be done in a browser using Gitpod.

Mike Nikles developed this course. Mike is a senior developer at Gitpod and a great teacher. 

This course covers everything from creating a new repository to deploying to production, and you will learn the reason for every line of code. The Svelte JavaScript framework is used for the frontend with Postgres as the database. The app is deployed using Vercel and Railway.

Here are all the sections covered in this course:

* The Gitpod developer environment
* Project Overview
* Project Architecture
* Initialize the application
* Intro to SvelteKit
* Configure Gitpod
* Develop HTML structure
* Apply CSS styles
* Develop CRUD endpoints: GET and POST
* Develop CRUD endpoints: DELETE
* Develop CRUD endpoints: PATCH - Edit Text
* Develop CRUD endpoints: PATCH - Mark as Done
* Enhance HTML forms
* Install & start the dev database
* Use Prisma ORM
* Update API to use Prisma
* Deploy Database on Railway
* Deploy web app & API on Vercel
* Project review
