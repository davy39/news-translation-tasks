Building projects is a great way to practice your skills, especially in web development.

We just published a course on the freeCodeCamp.org Spanish YouTube channel that will teach you how to build a Pokédex step by step with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, using data from the [PokéAPI](https://pokeapi.co/).

If you have Spanish-speaking friends, you are welcome to share the **[Spanish version of this article](https://www.freecodecamp.org/espanol/news/proyecto-de-html-css-y-javascript-crea-una-pokedex-paso-a-paso)** with them.

[Carpi Coder](https://www.youtube.com/c/CarpiCoder) teaches this course. He has been a web developer since 2014 and currently works on multiple projects. He has learned from many communities, including freeCodeCamp. 

In 2020, he started sharing his knowledge with the community through the videos that he shares on his YouTube channel. And now he is sharing this amazing project with the freeCodeCamp community.

## What the Course Covers

The course will teach you how to create a Pokédex with the most iconic Pokémon. You will get their data and statistics from the PokéAPI to show their names, images, numbers, categories, and weight.

You will also be able to filter the Pokémon based on their categories.
