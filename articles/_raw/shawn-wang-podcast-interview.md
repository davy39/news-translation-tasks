On this week's episode of the freeCodeCamp podcast, I interview Shawn Wang ([@swyx](https://twitter.com/swyx)). We talk about "learning in public" and his transition into tech from finance, where he left behind a job that paid him US $350,000 per year.

Shawn grew up in Singapore and came to the US as a college student.

He worked in finance, but at age 30, he burned out. So he decided to learn to code. He used freeCodeCamp and a ton of other resources, and since then he's worked as a freelance developer, and at several companies including Netlify.

It's a 2 hour listen in your favorite podcast player app - just search "freecodecamp" and you should find it. 

If you have an Amazon Echo, you can just say "Alexa - play the freeCodeCamp podcast."

Or you can listen to it or [right here in your browser](http://podcast.freecodecamp.org/ep-59-shawn-wang-left-a-350kyear-finance-job-to-learn-to-code). Enjoy the interview!
