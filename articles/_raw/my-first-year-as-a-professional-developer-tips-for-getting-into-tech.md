Hi everyone! In this article I'll share my thoughts on my first year of professional experience as a software developer.

It's almost been two years since I got into coding and a year since I became a full-time dev.

I started writing this article merely as a self-reflection exercise. But I thought maybe someone who's in a similar position as I am or is just starting to code right now might find some of my experiences useful or interesting.

I plan on talking about a lot of things here. I'll go over everything from my background and how I switched careers at almost thirty to how I learned to code and chose my tech stack.

I'll also discuss what I plan on learning in the future and why, along with some general advice and my overall feelings and thoughts about this first year of professional work.

The way I'm going to structure this is that first I'm going to tell you the story of how I became a developer. Then I'm going to list the main thoughts and concepts that have helped me get to where I am now.

This article is going to be [a bit different from what I usually write](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/author/gercocca/), in the sense that it won't be too technical and it might get too self-referential at some points. But the idea is to take you through my experience and thought process so you can get an idea of how things could be if you walked the same path.

Although always remember my opinions and experiences don't necessarily extend to everyone else. And I don't claim that my choices and preferences are necessarily the best. So you know... if you read through it all, just take whatever is useful to you and ignore the rest. :)

Enough cháchara, let's go!

# My Background

I'm a 29 year old guy from Buenos Aires, Argentina.

I grew up here, and once I finished high school I had no idea what to do with my life. I knew I had to go to college because that's what everybody else was doing. And according to "general knowledge", that was what was going to give me the best chances at life. So I started investigating around different career paths...

I was a shy and introverted adolescent in high school, so in this new chapter of my life I decided to change that and get more in contact with people and society in general.

I was attracted to social sciences studies such as philosophy, psychology and history. But It worried me that these professions weren't very in demand in the labor market. So I ended up choosing a major in human resources, as I thought it was a good match between social sciences and business.

I made this decision completely by myself, as I was part of the first generation of college students in my family. I didn't really know anyone who could guide me in this situation. I just made the best guess I could with the information I had.

Fast-forward a couple of years and I was starting to heavily regret my choice. I wasn't interested at all in what I was studying. The rigid structure and bureaucracy of college bored me to death and I had the feeling that I was wasting all my youth hearing people I didn't respect giving me meaningless lectures.

I started analyzing again what other career paths could I take, but nothing seemed to convince me enough. I even consulted with a group of vocational orientation professionals who charged me a ton of money for telling me that I was going to be a great HR manager in the future and that I should "just keep going".

This together with the fact that I had already put two years into this college thing convinced me to "just keep going".

Fast-forward another couple of years and I still felt the same way, but at least I was close to graduation and I was also working. So I was still bored to death but at least I was making money out of it.

I finally graduated and exited college with the feeling of having learned almost nothing, just happy that I was finally going to have more free time.

Regarding work, I started climbing the corporate ladder. Switching jobs every once in a while, making a tiny bit more money, and working for big and well known companies.

At this point I somehow got convinced that I liked this life, and even though I never enjoyed my job or being in the office environment, this was part of the deal.

In 2017 I was working for a very big industrial company and was offered the chance to move almost a thousand miles away from Buenos Aires, in exchange for a salary raise and the promise of future professional growth. I thought about it and accepted, as at the moment it seemed like too much of a great opportunity to pass by.

The work environment in this new position was terrible. I had to deal with crappy tasks, crappy leaders, and crappy people in general. I was learning nothing and the promises of future professional growth ended up being BS.

Things kept going the same direction for a few years, and when the pandemic arrived I was working harder than ever, often putting in nights and weekends, but somehow my leaders weren't happy with my effort.

I was feeling stuck and bitter. I left my family back in Buenos Aires in order to grow my career, and even though I was working as hard as I could, I wasn't collecting any profits and I was disliking my job more than ever.

At this point I finally opened my eyes and realized I couldn't be there anymore. I didn't know what to do next but I definitely knew I had to get out of there.

Then I saw an ad somewhere about a programming course and started investigating coding. I was always interested in technology, and at the moment it just felt right to occupy my mind with something new.

I didn't think about it as a way to get a new job, but as a hobby, a way to get my brain to think about something else.

# How I Learned to Code

So after seeing this add and getting interested in coding, I did what most people do when looking for information: I Googled things, opened a ton of browser tabs, and watched a million YouTube videos.

I remember at the time I often couldn't understand a single thing about those videos. So many strange terms where used and people related each of those terms to other topics I had no idea about.

I didn't really know how computers worked, much less how the internet worked. I didn't know what a programming language was, why there were so many of them, what was the difference between front and back-end, what a function was, what a variable was, what on earth was SQL ... So many concepts and all of them completely new.

I just didn't know where to start. Learning to code felt [like staring at the wall of Game of thrones](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGcKOXk9Qbs).

![Image](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2022/08/image-1.png align="left")

*I was feeling like the recruiter here...*

Here's where I got back to freeCodeCamp (I had done a bit of a basic HTML and CSS course a few years ago) and also downloaded an app called [Mimo](https://getmimo.com/) (which helps you learn to code in a [Duolingo](https://duolingo.com/) kind of way).

These structured courses helped me organize my learning and grasp the basics of things before moving onto more complex topics. I dedicated a few hours every day to these two resources, and after a few months I was able to build a very very simple HTML and CSS page.

After that I felt I needed to interact with other people who were in the same learning path I was. I wanted to share knowledge with others, hear from other people's experiences, and check if what I was doing and learning made sense compared to what everyone else was doing.

The way I got to this was by signing up for a few online bootcamp courses. I liked that classes were live with a professor and a bunch of other students. This meant that I had the chance to ask questions, hear other people's questions too, and compare myself to others.

Four months went by and at that point I was completely into coding. I'd become comfortable with HTML and CSS, and also learned basic programming concepts with JavaScript. I was dedicating absolutely all my free time to this and even though slowly, I felt like I was making progress each day.

By this time luckily I was able to switch jobs (still within the human resources field) and get back to Buenos Aires. I was working in a much nicer environment and I was happy with my job and the team I had. But I still kept coding and learning about it every day. I just liked it a lot and felt I could be good at it some day.

A few more months went by, I completed more bootcamp courses, and got comfortable with React as well. I was able to build some more interesting and "complex" projects on my own and with the passing of time I got more and more curious about how could it feel to do this for a living.

I could somehow picture myself as a developer, and after doubting a lot I decided to give it a try and started applying for jobs.

I got rejected A LOT and struggled BIG TIME with the few interviews I was able to get (you can read more about that in [the article I wrote about tech interview tips](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/problem-solving-and-technical-interview-prep/)).

Some of those interviews were like a reality check for me in the sense that they made me realize there was still an immense amount of things I knew nothing about and I'd need to keep improving if I was ever to have the chance of working as a dev.

These experiences kind of hurt my self esteem and made me doubt if I could do this. I gave up coding for a few weeks for the first time in almost a year, but eventually got back to it. I just liked it a lot and felt like I had to prove the people who rejected me wrong.

By this time I started to expand the resources I was using to learn. Live classes weren't that interesting for me anymore since I felt I didn't need constant feedback from others like I did when I was starting.

Now that I had a wide array of knowledge, terms, and concepts at least superficially present in my mind, I could easily take advantage of asynchronous resources like videos, articles, and documentation.

And more importantly, I knew what path I needed to go through in order to learn what I needed to learn to get to the jobs I wanted.

So I reduced the number of live classes I was taking, and started getting more into videos, articles, and documentation of good trusted sources I found.

Also, I started writing about each of the things I was learning, which made a huge difference for me as it helped me internalize knowledge, go into detail on each of the topics I learned, and gain confidence in a way I hadn't experienced before.

In parallel I was still going through different interview processes and feeling better and more confident in these situations. And in one of these processes I ended up getting hired. 🙃

After a year of learning, burning my brain, and dedicating absolutely all my free time to code, I finally reached my goal.

I remember I felt as happy as I'd ever felt when I got the news. It felt like ending a marathon. I'd never before put so much consistent effort into something, and the feeling of going from knowing nothing about technology to being able to call myself a "programmer" was amazing.

It was really a great moment, but to tell the truth, I was also scared to the bone... When I looked into the mirror I didn't see a programmer. I saw a guy who still didn't know much. And now I was going to switch careers and put my financial (and emotional) stability at risk. Crap... 😳

# My First Job as a Developer

Luckily, all the fears I had going into my first developer job were unfounded. I landed on an amazing company, and got to work on an amazing team with an amazing leader.

There were TONS of new things to learn, and at moments I couldn't understand a single thing. But my team made it clear to me that this was what it was supposed to feel like and that I should be patient and stick to the process of learning.

I did, and I took it step by step. With the help of my leader and teammates I was able to become pretty much proficient in a matter of months.

My team had a great culture and our leader encouraged us to share knowledge all the time. If someone found a bug, created a new feature, or wrote some documentation, that had to be shared with the rest of the group.

The same went for when someone made a mistake. Mistakes were not treated as opportunities to blame someone, but as chances for everyone to learn.

We had weekly meetings in which we shared this kind of information with each other. Through this continuous exchange I made a huge "click" in my mind. I understood **no one knows everything**.

Before I got this job, one of my biggest fears was that I wasn't prepared enough. There were many things I knew nothing about and I felt I "was supposed" to know them. But after getting to know developers with 5, 8, or more years of experience, I understood even with that amount of study and preparation, they still don't know everything. And that's ok, because no one can.

The size of the technological world humans have created and the constant evolution of it just makes it impossible for a single person to understand and know every single detail.

What I think is truly important is to deeply understand the given set of tools you work with in your environment, and to have a superficial understanding of the general system you work within.

But even then, you'll still never understand everything. **Learning new things all the time and figuring things out is a core part of the job**. In fact, what most companies pay engineers for is to figure things out. You just face problems you don't know how to solve at first, and slowly figure them out until you arrive to a solution.

This single idea was very powerful to me, and allowed me to get over the impostor syndrome I felt.

Overall I was feeling awesome at my new job. I was working remotely all the time (which I love and allows me to spend more time with my family and pets). I was working with people I felt related to in the sense that everyone was interested in sharing knowledge and constantly learning. And I felt my job was stimulating and interesting.

I was using my brain everyday, having to think in order to solve stuff, and that made me feel alive and useful instead of the zombie-like feelings I had in past jobs.

The feeling I had (and still have) is that my job and my hobby are the same thing. I'm not longer living for the weekend ([great song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGardUiWjR4) by the way). I enjoy my job and I still dedicate most of my free time to learning and doing code-related things because I like it.

# Present Tense and Future

After 9 months at my first job as a developer, I got the chance to switch jobs again. It was hard to leave such a great team and leader, but in my current position I'm able to work with cool technologies on a big and interesting project. Also, changing companies and projects has allowed me to understand a little bit better the process of software development and how different companies manage it.

It's also very interesting to get to know other fellow developers and learn from them. I feel there're things to learn from every single person working in this industry, so getting to know and work with new people every once in a while is something I'd like to keep practicing.

Besides focusing on my job, I also got back into college to study computer engineering. I made this decision because I felt most of the courses and classes I took focused heavily on learning to use tools (such as React or Node for example), but I lacked the basic knowledge those things were built upon.

I wanted to have deep knowledge about computer science topics too, and even though there're many ways in which you can get this knowledge, college made sense for me.

I find it funny that I'm having a completely different experience now compared to my first time at university. I'm attending classes with curiosity and learning at least a few useful things every time. Being truly interested in what you're learning and understanding the purpose of the information really makes a huge difference.

And besides those two things, I'm also working as a part-time assistant teacher in a coding bootcamp and trying to periodically write articles.

Sharing knowledge with others is something I really like and appreciate about the coding world, and without a doubt is one of the things that has allowed me to learn the most. [Lots of people have benefited from this practice](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkm0TNFzIeg) and I'm not an exception.

Regarding the future, I want to train myself as a well rounded software engineer. And by this I mean I'm aiming to gain knowledge about the whole ecosystem of things that lays around the creation of web-based software: front-end and back-end development, testing, infrastructure, cloud technologies, CI/CD, systems design and so on.

I feel that having at least a superficial knowledge of the core concepts in each of these fields is important and valuable, even though if end up specializing in a certain field later on. So this is what I'm directing my attention towards at the moment... and the rest is just to keep going.

Reflecting on the steps I took in the last few years, from the position I'm in now, I kind of appreciate how the experiences I had led me to where I am now.

Working in the social sciences environment for several years allowed me to gain the social skills I lacked when I was an adolescent. Also, working in toxic environments forged my character and gave me the ability to appreciate good teams and leaders.

It's likely that if I had never gone through those unpleasant experiences I would've never gotten into coding.

Life is really weird... I don't like to pretend I know how it works. I don't think anyone does. But in these past years I learned for myself that I can do whatever I set my mind to if I put enough time and effort into it.

I also learned that I should never settle for a situation I'm not comfortable in. What I like to do for a living is learning, thinking, and using my brain to solve problems.

# Tips and Thoughts

So now that we're done with the *telenovela*, I'm going to present you with the main concepts and thoughts that have helped me get to where I am now.

Again, keep in mind this is not direct advice. Some of these things might not apply to you, but the idea is to share them so you can analyze and make decisions for yourself.

## Learn How to Learn

If you'd like to become a developer, become comfortable learning things constantly. As I mentioned, I think this is a core part of the job for most of us.

Get used to the struggle of not understanding things at first, asking questions, doing research, making little or no progress at all, giving it another try, googling, watching videos, reading articles... and slowly but surely getting to what you want.

If you struggle and at times feel you're just not capable of understanding anything, that's ok! We all feel that way. The important thing is to be consistent, don't give up, be curious and keep going. You'll eventually wrap your head around things – just don't expect it to be easy or quick.

![Image](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2022/08/image-39.png align="left")

I think the best way to learn how to learn is just to keep trying. It's like a muscle: if you push it it will get stronger.

The cool thing is that things get easier as you advance. The more concepts and ideas you understand, the more connection points you'll have for the next topic you get into, which will accelerate your learning curve and help you move faster.

## Try to Find a Path

The best thing about learning how to code is that there's so much information out there. The worst thing about it is also that there's so much information out there.

At the beginning everything sounds foreign and hard, so I think getting some kind of structure is of great help.

There're many sources for you to choose from. Free and with a cost, live or asynchronous, to learn alone or in a group... It's up to you and what you find works for you.

I'd say it's a good idea to start with something free to test if you like it. Then try different sources and work with the one or two you're more comfortable with.

Also, during the first steps, I feel like having the companionship of a tutor or a community is key to continue your learning path.

So much info can be overwhelming and it can be hard to know what to do next. A community and people to ask questions from can help diminish this level of uncertainty at the beginning.

Live classes solved this problem for me, but there are tons of ways to get in touch with people who are learning to code, so find one that suits yourself.

Also, after a while and once you have a clear understanding of your environment and what do you want to do, live classes can start to get less efficient and asynchronous learning becomes the best thing to do.

So getting to know useful and trustworthy sources of knowledge is key. And I don't have a recipe for this – for me it was just a matter of countless hours of exploring blogs, YouTube channels, and websites. And of course still all the time I'm finding great resources...

And about that, [here I've put together some of the coolest resources I've found](https://alexandria-rust.vercel.app/) recently. Maybe it could be a good starting point for somebody. I'd also like to receive recommendations if you have any. 😉

## Do You Need a College Degree to Work in Technology?

Absolutely not. I was able to get a good developer job without a related college degree.

Also, if you're just looking to switch jobs and get into tech, I'd recommend going to a bootcamp or completing some free online courses. It will probably be much quicker and cheaper for you than learning through college.

What I do think is that if you can afford going to college (both money and time wise), a degree won't hurt at all. And through college you can learn a series of general foundational concepts not often available in a bootcamp or programming courses (though this information is also available in other media and for free as well).

In my country, college education is relatively cheap and there are quality free options as well. So college was a reasonable choice for me. But this may vary from country to country and from person to person.

## What Kind of Developer Do You Want to Become?

Once you start to comprehend the technology world, you'll see that the software engineer profession has many different paths and nuances. To name a few:

* **Front end developers:** Build the visual side of websites
    
* **Mobile developers:** Build mobile apps
    
* **Back end developers:** Work with all the software that is not directly exposed to the end user, like databases, authentication, and so on.
    
* **Testing / QA:** These people write programs to test that the software developed works as expected.
    

And many other paths like **infrastructure, data analytics, robotics,** and so on.

At first you won't be able to tell the difference between the one and the other, and that's ok. A good idea is to do a little research to understand all the possibilities that exist within the software engineering world, and see what you like most.

Also keep in mind there're different environments you can work in. From huge worldwide corporations to tiny startups, to freelance work, to starting your own company... Anything is possible.

Different fields and different environments make different experiences, and some might be better suited for what you like and what you're interested in. And also they'll require you to learn different things to get to work in those places.

## How to Pick a Tech Stack

This is closely related to the kind of job and the environment you'd like to get. Though all knowledge is useful, some technologies are more related to one field and one type of environment in particular. So choosing carefully what to learn will help you use your time more efficiently and get to your goal quicker.

If I had to give a general path that applies to most people, I'd say get to know basic HTML, CSS and core programming concepts with JavaScript (variables, functions, loops, conditionals, data structures, and so on).

There're are lots of online resources where you can get this knowledge, and having these concepts under your belt will help you to some degree no matter what path you choose later.

I also feel that it's the easiest way to get into software since you start from a visual perspective that will allow you to build at least a very simple website in a few weeks.

Once you're there, I'd recommend that you analyze the different possible career paths and decide what you like the most or find the most interesting.

Watch videos, read articles, talk to people... Get a feeling of what each kind of job is about and what technologies are used in each of them. Then based on that, keep learning.

I find it's also important to choose based on what's available for you. For me, the bootcamp I was learning in had React and Node courses available, so that kind of laid the path for me. Maybe if they had Angular and Python courses I would've learned those technologies instead.

I don't really think it makes that much of a difference as long as the technologies serve your purposes. In the long run, technologies are only tools. And you can use many different tools to arrive to the same results.

Also keep in mind no choice is definitive. I mean, if you get into something and find that you don't like it, you can always get back and learn something else. It's useful to have some kind of plan and learning path, but it's not something rigid that can't be changed ever again.

Just to give you a superficial idea, the path I followed (and I'm still following) looks like this:

* HTML
    
* CSS
    
* Git and GitHub
    
* Basic terminal usage
    
* JavaScript
    
* React
    
* Node, Express, MongoDB and PostgreSQL
    
* Algorithms and data structures
    
* Testing: Jest, react testing library and Cypress
    
* TypeScript
    
* Intermediate terminal usage and scripting (Bash)
    
* React Native
    
* Firebase / AWS
    
* GraphQL
    
* Python
    
* Docker
    

## Don't Jump Around Too Much

The idea of having a learning path is to provide structure and meaning to knowledge you'll acquire, so you can get to your goals quicker.

As I mentioned before, there's a huge amount of information out there and that's awesome if you know what you're looking for. But if you're not certain about what you need to learn, you might get lost between all the different possibilities and end up knowing just a tiny bit of a lot of things – and that's not really useful.

At least at the beginning, I'd recommend that you dedicate at least a few weeks to each new tool or concept you're learning. Make sure the knowledge sinks in and build a project or two with the tool you're learning, and then hop on to the next thing.

If possible, with each new thing you learn, try to add it to the same project or build a new one with all the tools you know up to that point.

For example, if you learned React before and now you're learning about back-end with Node, a good idea would be to build a front-end for that back-end too. Practice and repetition will make you better.

I also wouldn't recommend learning more than one thing at the same time. For example, let's say you're building your first React project and you're using TypeScript for the first time as well. That could be problematic, because when you get an error you might not be able to distinguish if it's a React or a TypeScript thing. You could also confuse concepts that belong to one technology with the other.

## Don't Be Too Comfortable or Get Ahead of Yourself

Following the previous thought, I think it's important to push yourself and try to learn new things all the time. But it's also important to know where you are and control your rhythm. By this I mean, know when you need to move to the next thing and know when you need to stick to what you're learning at the moment.

This is a hard thing to know, and there's no way to be absolutely sure. I'd say you don't need to become an absolute expert, but at least build two decent projects with each technology you learn.

Make sure you understand the basic concepts behind it, understand the most common errors and problems you can face using it, compare your code to other people's code, and so on. If you feel you understand and can relate to most concepts regarding to that particular technology, then you're probably ready to learn something else.

Regarding what to learn next, that depends on your learning path and the things you've learned previously. I'd say a good sign is when you're able to connect some of the previous knowledge you have to the new things you're learning.

For example, if you learned HTML and now you're getting into CSS, you'll be able to understand how CSS helps you configure how HTML elements look and behave. If you learned JavaScript before, you'll be able to understand how TypeScript helps you control types and so on.

On the other hand, if you're [trying to learn React without having a clue about JavaScript](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/top-javascript-concepts-to-know-before-learning-react/), you're very likely to mix concepts and confuse what technology is responsible for each thing (for example, I've seen many people think `map`, `filter` and `reduce` functions are a React thing, while they're all ES6 JavaScript features).

Consuming the right amount of information is important. Too little and you won't make progress, too much and you'll get confused and not make progress either.

## How to Know When You're Job Ready

Short answer is you'll never know. You'll need to try yourself and (probably) fail to see what you still need to get better at.

There's not an exact recipe to get a job. Companies require different skills and have different levels of demand for their candidates.

I'd say a good place to start would be to go through job postings and see what kind of knowledge is required for the types of jobs you like. Once you're more or less comfortable with most of the things they require, I'd say start applying.

Waiting too long to apply for jobs can also hurt you. Even though doing badly at an interview sucks (I know, trust me...), it will really help you realize what knowledge you lack, and in that way accelerate your learning process.

You can [read through this interviewing guide I wrote](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/problem-solving-and-technical-interview-prep/) to help you prepare as much as you're able.

## Sometimes Not Coding is the Best Way to Learn About Code

I feel that when you start out, building things is the best way to learn about programming. It gives you practical knowledge and the feeling of progress (which is key to get over the frustration any learning process involves).

But once you get comfortable with the practical side of things, I think it's also important to get a theoretical foundation. Learning how tools work, how the internet works, how computers work, the history of computer science, algorithms and data structures, and so on. I don't mean becoming an expert, but at least superficial knowledge of these topics is useful.

Regarding how to get this, you can go with videos, articles, books, courses... Again, there're countless resources to pick from.

But something I found really useful is to actually create content. Writing stuff, sharing knowledge, helping others – it all makes you think about code and programming from a different angle and have a deeper understanding of topics.

This is one of the main reasons why I like writing articles. And what I find the most interesting about it is that when I get back to actually coding, I feel that I'm a better programmer than I was before. I guess sometimes not coding is the best way to get good at it.

## Diversify Your Learning Sources

I think a good way to wrap your head around complex topics is hearing different "voices" explain the same thing. Different people will use different analogies, vocabulary and approaches to explain. And eventually you'll find one that works for you.

Same goes to different formats like videos, articles, courses, and so on. Each time you're learning a new thing, try to combine different learning sources together so you can get a good general idea of it.

## Keep in Mind that Nobody Knows Everything

Looking from the outside, it may seem that people working in the industry know so much more than you. But they don't know everything.

Senior developers normally have deep knowledge in some particular stack, but they don't know everything about everything, so much less should you if you're just starting out your learning path.

For me, being curious, eager to learn, and consistent in your learning efforts is the most important.

## There're Good and Bad Things Too

For me, technology is the best possible environment to work in right now. Jobs are interesting and well paid, and the job market demand for developers is high (and it will probably keep growing in the future).

It's also one of the few sectors in which you can have a good job without a college degree.

I love it, and getting into technology has made a very positive change in my life. But I also think It's important to reflect about some of the negative things around it. For example:

#### Working remotely has challenges

Working remotely is great in many senses. For me, it has given me much more control over my time. It has allowed me to save tons of commuting hours and invest those hours into studying, spending more time with my pets and family, or just sleeping more. On the other hand, I recognize it has also separated me a lot from people and society in general which sometimes leads me to feelings of isolation, monotony, and social anxiety.

#### Working in tech can be stressful

Working in a project-based environment (which is the most common thing in technology) is awesome. You get to do different things every once in a while, facing different challenges, learning new things and getting the feeling of progress and accomplishment. But on the other hand, the pressure of dealing with deadlines and needing to solve technical problems so things can get done can be hard to deal with, especially at the beginning and on occasions where you don't have help from others.

#### While most people are nice...some really aren't

Though most people I've met in tech are nice, curious, and really eager to learn and share knowledge, there're also some egotistic, arrogant, and selfish people too. There're good and bad people in all paths of life.

#### Technology has a huge impact on our lives

To a bigger or lesser degree, by working in technology we're designing and making decisions that shape an important part of the world's reality and people's lives.

Think about it – technology is everyday becoming more and more intrinsically connected to everything we do as humans. From deciding what or where to eat, to traveling, to meeting new people and building relationships, to buying things, studying, managing money, looking for jobs or something so basic and central like getting to know the world around us. Googling has become the most primary action for most of us when we want to get information about anything.

Technology is absolutely everywhere around us. And as developers, this is great for us because it gives us a huge platform to impact people's lives in a positive way.

But that platform can also impact people's lives in a negative way too. As humans we've become so dependable on technology that decisions made by tech companies and engineers can have the same or more impact on society than those made by politicians.

We're all more addicted to our cellphones than we'd like to admit. Social networks have been used by companies to have a very detailed understanding of our expectations, preferences, fears and emotions. And from that knowledge, get us to buy things we don't need to impress people we don't like ([yeah](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49FB9hhoO6c)), or even worse, [manipulate people's political opinions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVHKYXJq7qo&t=15s).

Technology is a very powerful tool, and that tool can be used both for good and for bad. The purpose and impact of it is up to us to decide, both as users and as developers.

# Wrapping up

Well, I've talked about a lot of things here. I hope some of these concepts helped you picture how it may be to work in the technology industry yourself. Or at least cause you just to think and reflect about a thing or two.

If you read through all of this, I'd love to hear about your feedback or your own story in tech. You can hit me up on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/germancocca/) or [Twitter](https://twitter.com/CoccaGerman) if you'd like. 😉

Here's a little [goodbye song for you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kr2473XpG98) (I'm making this a thing now 🤷‍♂️). See you in the next one.✌️
