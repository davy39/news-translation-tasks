## How to Add a Gmail Profile Picture in Google

Instead of telling you to click through a bunch of links to find where you can set this, I'm just going to give you a link to it. **Here it is: [Google's My Account About Me page](https://myaccount.google.com/personal-info?gar=1).**

This is what the page looks like:

_Google's About Me page. You can change a lot of other important things here as well, including important privacy settings._

Note that the process of adding a new profile picture and changing your existing picture is exactly the same. Here's how to do this.

First, click on the circle with the camera icon in it.

Then you can upload a new picture or choose one from your Google Images folder.

Once you've chosen an image, you can tweak it before confirming. The image has to be a perfect square, but Google gives you a tool to reposition or zoom in and out.

Presto. You have now updated your profile photo.

## How to Remove your Profile Photo from Google

You can't technically remove your profile photo – only update it.

But here is a 400 by 400 pixel white square that you can right click and save to your hard drive.

_You can right click this square. (It's white and you may not be able to see it, but it is there.) Save it to your hard drive, then upload this to Google to replace your unwanted profile image._

Then you can go to [Google's My Account page](https://myaccount.google.com/personal-info?gar=1) and upload the image to serve as your new image.

Now your profile image appear completely blank.

### I hope this tutorial has been helpful

Now you can put your best foot forward in Gmail with a cool profile picture. (Or no profile picture at all if you are concerned about your privacy.) That was easy, wasn't it.

You know what isn't easy? Learning to code. It is a multi-year endeavor. But if you're interested in developing some new skills and exploring new job opportunities, freeCodeCamp has a ton of free learning resources for you. Spend some time here, and tell your friends. 😉
