AgularJS is one of the most versatile and popular frameworks available today. Google introduced it in 2012. It provides a scalable infrastructure that supports Google’s largest applications.

_AngularJS Development_

[**AngularJS**](https://angularjs.org/), a structured JavaScript framework, builds dynamic single page applications. It is a client-side framework that supports multiple platforms. All the functions and commands of this framework use code templates written in HTML script.

Moreover, the AngularJS framework has many powerful features. These features allow decoupling any application logic from DOM (Document Object Model) manipulation. It also provides a host of amazing and useful features. This is why [**AngularJS development**](https://www.goodfirms.co/directory/languages/top-software-development-companies/angularjs) is often the preferred option for businesses.

### **Here is a list of features that AngularJS offers**

#### **1. Model View Controller (MVC) Framework**

MVC is a software design pattern for developing web applications. It is made up of:

**Model:** the first level of the pattern which is responsible for maintaining data. It is similar to primitive data types like booleans, numbers, strings or objects. It is the simplest script without any getter and sorter methods.

**View:** responsible for showing portions of data to the user. They present the data in a particular format triggered by the controller’s action.

**Controller:** controls the interaction between the Model and the View. It responds to user input and interacts with the data model objects. The controller receives the input, validates it, and then conducts the operations.

As AngularJS is an open-source script, the working model is based on MVC patterns and the newest client-side JavaScript. The Model View Framework Control Architecture in AngularJS is easy, versatile, and dynamic.

MVC makes it easier to build a separate client-side application. With AngularJS, even if the MVC elements were developed separately, you can combine them. There is no need to write extra code to combine all the attributes together.

#### **2. User interface with HTML**

User interfaces in AngularJS are built on HTML. It is a declarative language which has shorter tags and is extremely easy to comprehend. Even the interface it provides is organized, smooth, and structured.

Many times, it becomes complex to develop, organize, and reorganize the JavaScript Interfaces. So, the HTML interface can also regulate the implementation of the application. So, rather than understanding program flow and loading, you can define what you want and AngularJS will carve out the dependencies.

#### **3. POJO Model**

As compared to other frameworks, AngularJS uses POJO (Plain Old JavaScript) objects. Now, that means you do not need to add additional getter and setter elements to bind AngularJS along with additional data sources.

A POJO model also provides spontaneous and well-planned objects. Developers have to create loops of objects and loops of arrays with the required properties. Then they need to adjust and reframe it.

This makes AngularJS self-sufficient and easy to use. The well planned and quick application of the POJO model is one of the [reasons to use AngularJS in your next development project](https://topcompaniesreview.wordpress.com/2018/05/15/what-makes-angularjs-a-powerful-javascript-framework-for-your-web-development/).

#### **4. Active community on Google**

Whenever you want to adopt a framework for development, you always look for good community support. AngularJS doesn’t disappoint here either.

Why? Because Google maintains AngularJS. In addition to that, it is released under the MIT license and is available for download on GitHub.

So, if you have any maintenance issues or get stuck somewhere, there are many forums where you can get your queries solved. Also, if you have any suggestions or any can improve something, the source is easily available for download.

#### **5. Routing**

Routing is basically the transition from one view to another. Now, this is the key aspect of single page applications.

In single page applications, everything comes in one single page. Developers don’t want to redirect the users to a new page every time they click on a menu or a sub-menu. The developers want the content to load asynchronously on the same page with just the URL changing.

Almost all websites work on this method. Some of the popular platforms like the Chrome app store and Twitter are the best examples of Single Page Applications. This method helps the user feel as if they are interacting with a desktop app.

Now, with AngularJS, this becomes an easy task and you can make various views for various URLs. AngularJS also enables you to load the appropriate view in the main page for a specific URL request. This is another reason why [developers love AngularJS](https://www.goodfirms.co/directory/languages/top-software-development-companies).

#### **6. Two-way binding**

Data binding is the automatic synchronization of data between the view and the model. The view indicates the HTML and the model indicates the JavaScript variables.

In AngularJS, you can easily build a template which can bind different components with different models. In this way, whenever the value of any HTML or view component differs, the bound model value also gets updated.

Let’s say if the input text value changes, the bound model is also changed and updated accordingly. To control the changing data, there is no need to program a separate set of callback functions.

With two-way data binding, the application's presentation layer becomes very simple. As a result, the UI is clean and has an improved appeal. Also, complex data manipulations and calculations can be done with ease.

### **To sum up**

Cross-browser web applications built using AngularJS are user-friendly and interactive. One more benefit of AngularJS is that it analyzes the page DOM and then builds bindings which are based on AngularJS-specific elements.

As a result, it significantly reduces the coding part as compared to other frameworks. A single code set for one application and your task is done. Also, less coding means reduced chances of error.

AngularJS is a great multi-functional framework which speeds up your development process. It offers dependency injection and deep linking, and is a robust platform for software development.
