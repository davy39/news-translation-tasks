Microservices architecture has become a popular approach for building scalable and maintainable applications. By breaking down large applications into smaller, independent services, developers can improve performance, maintainability, and scalability. If you're looking to master microservices with Nest.js, we have the perfect course for you.

We just published a course on the [freeCodeCamp.org](http://freeCodeCamp.org) YouTube channel that will teach you how to build microservices using Nest.js. Taught by Hhaider Malik, this course walks you through building a delivery service application that tracks rider activity by saving their coordinates every three hours. You'll develop two microservices—a Login Service and a Rider Service—and enable seamless communication between them. By the end of the course, you'll have the skills to design, develop, and deploy scalable microservices using Nest.js and MongoDB.

### What You’ll Learn

This hands-on course covers essential topics for building microservices, including:

* **Setting up a Nest.js microservices project** – Learn how to scaffold and structure a Nest.js application for microservices.
    
* **Using MongoDB with Docker** – Understand the importance of Docker, run MongoDB in a container, and use Docker Compose for setup.
    
* **Schema design and data validation** – Define schemas using Mongoose and validate request bodies to ensure data integrity.
    
* **Inter-microservice communication** – Implement TCP-based communication between services and use events for interaction.
    
* **Testing and debugging** – Learn how to test microservices and fix common issues to ensure reliability.
    

### Why This Course?

Nest.js is a powerful framework that simplifies building scalable server-side applications with TypeScript. This course provides practical, real-world experience by guiding you through building and testing a real microservices-based project.
