Now you can learn coding concepts hands-free using an Amazon Echo.

freeCodeCamp.org contributor [David Jolliffe](https://github.com/OcelotDive) created a quiz game with questions on JavaScript, CSS, networking, and computer science.

If you have an Amazon Echo nearby, you can play the game right now by saying: "Alexa, start the free code camp quiz."

The entire project, along with it's ~100 questions, is [open source and on GitHub](https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/FreeCodeCampTriviaQuiz). We would welcome additional questions. Open a pull request adding your new question to the codebase, or just open a GitHub issue with the question if you're in a hurry.

Here's a video of me and my 11-month-old son Quentin demonstrating the Alexa skill. You can watch the video on [the freeCodeCamp.org YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFAmuQgjMK0) (3 minute watch).‌
