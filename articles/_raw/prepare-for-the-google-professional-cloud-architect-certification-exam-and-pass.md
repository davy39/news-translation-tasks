We just released a full course on the freeCodeCamp.org YouTube channel to help you prepare for the Google Cloud Professional Cloud Architect (GCP-PCA) certification exam.

The Professional Cloud Architect certification is one of Google Cloud’s top credentials. Cloud Architects use their knowledge of Google Cloud services to design, deploy, and manage secure, scalable, and cost-effective cloud solutions for organizations.

This course, created by Andrew Brown, covers everything you need to know to get ready for the exam. You’ll learn about identity and access management, networking, storage, compute options, serverless deployment, and much more. The course also walks through case studies, which are a big part of the exam itself.

Topics include:

* Identity access and resource setup
    
* Billing configuration
    
* Serverless and app deployment
    
* Data storage options
    
* Compute Engine and GKE deployment
    
* Networking resources
    
* Infrastructure as Code (IaC)
    
* Monitoring and logging
    
* Cloud identity and directory services
    
* Case studies
