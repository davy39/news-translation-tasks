Learn how to create quiz app with React and TypeScript. We've published a [free course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2JCjVSZlG0) from Thomas Weibenfalk on the freeCodeCamp.org YouTube channel.

Building projects is a great way to learn. In this course, you will learn how to create an interactive quiz application project. Thomas demonstrates all the steps clearly from start-to-finish so you can easily follow along on your own computer.

First, you will learn to bootstrap the app with create-react-app, using TypeScript. Then, you will learn to build out the project with React and TypeScript, including Styled-Components. The quiz questions will come from a trivia API. You will learn how to use the API with React.

Using Typescript can help make sure your variables and props are what you intend since it evaluates your code during compile-time (as opposed to run-time). This becomes especially important as your program becomes larger.
