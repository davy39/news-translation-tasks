If you're a web developer, designer, or project manager, you're likely quite busy these days and have a lot on your plate. 

This is partly because the number of websites is growing rapidly, with [71% of all businesses](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/business/software/website-statistics/) in the world having one. In fact, every three seconds a site is launched!

So software development is a growing field, and developers have many responsibilities when it comes to creating quality websites and web apps. You have to keep up with changing trends while staying productive and organized. And you'll often find yourself working on multiple projects while collaborating with stakeholders.

But don't worry: you can boost your productivity and empower yourself and your team by using the right collaborative tools. In this article, I'll share some of my favorite such tools with you so you can start using them.

## What are Collaboration Tools in Web Development?

Collaborative tools are software apps and platforms that help teams communicate, collaborate, track projects, and do collaborative coding. These tools ensure that team members will be able to work together smoothly, increasing productivity and helping them meet project deadlines.

Different collaboration tools, such as annotation tools, social media platforms, and version control, serve different purposes. They can help you and your team with task tracking or simply keeping everyone updated on the situation. 

Some popular ones are GitHub for version control, Slack for real-time communication, Trello for project management, Google Docs for collaborative document editing, Jira for issue tracking, and Asana for task management.

## How to Pick the Right Collaboration Tool for Your Needs

It can be challenging to pick a project management tool given all the available options. So here are some important factors you should consider before choosing a tool.

### Verify Project Requirements

Consider the distinctive features of your project in order to determine what functions and features you need. Think about things like task management, code collaboration, communication, and integration of different tools when deciding which tool best suits your requirements. 

You can also streamline various tasks using online tools. For instance at my company, we developed an [online website builder](https://www.logodesign.net/web) which was a long-term project. Our design and developer teams used collaborative tools like Slack and Git to track progress and final deliverables. 

### Check Integration and Compatibility

Collaboration platforms should integrate seamlessly with your existing technology ecosystem. Ensure that the tools you choose are compatible with the development environment and programming language(s) you use.

You should also make sure that your collaboration tool works with any project management software you use, your version control system, and repositories to avoid errors. 

For example, GitHub offers a version control platform that integrates smoothly with various development tools and services including project management platforms like Trello and Asana. It also provides continuous integration services like Travis CI and CircleCI, as well as code review tools like Codecov and Code Climate.

### Choose User-Friendly Tools

Try to choose collaboration tools that are simple to use. Your tools should be intuitive and easily adaptable for users with minimal (or no) training. 

The best collaborative tools create a good user experience and they should increase your efficiency and productivity. 

For example, as a widely used messaging platform, Slack's intuitive interface and simple channel organization make it easy for web development teams to communicate in real-time and share files quickly.

Google Docs is another popular tool that almost everyone is accustomed to or uses. It’s very helpful in sharing written content or any other project documentation.

### Consider Privacy and Security

Often, your team's projects under development are built based on confidential information and intellectual property. So you'll want to make sure that you choose the most secure tools, which include encryption and access controls. Industry standards are often a good bet.

For example, [Jira](https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira/guides/getting-started/introduction) is a popular collaboration tool for developers and offers options for cloud or self-hosted deployments. It also implements security best practices. Likewise, Microsoft Teams and Slack offer end-to-end encryptions that safeguard sensitive copyrighted and development information.

### Scalability

The tool's scalability is another factor you should keep in mind. As your projects become more complicated, the tool will need to be able to handle such complexities. You might also need to add members to your team as it grows. 

As an example, Hibox provides data privacy features, encrypted communication, and scalability for teams of different sizes.

### Pricing 

You'll want to compare the pricing and subscription plans of various collaboration tools before making your choice. It is important to consider your budget and the value each tool provides. As a result, you will be able to find the most cost-effective option that meets the needs of your team.

Some tools like Skype and Google Docs are free to use for everyone, but they might not fulfill your needs. You can opt for paid ones like [Monday.com](http://monday.com) or [Wrike](https://www.wrike.com/) which have a basic pricing plan of around $9 to $10 per month that may suit your needs. You can always upgrade to the Pro plan if the basic one is insufficient. 

## 7 Best Collaboration Tools for Web Developers

Now you should understand the benefits of using collaboration tools and what to consider when choosing one. 

Let's go over 7 of my favorite online collaboration tools you can use to help your team manage complex projects. 

### Webvizio

[Webvizio](https://webvizio.com/), a new player in the market, transforms online communication and collaboration into a visual experience using visual collaboration tools. It is part of a single integrated workspace, and it's one of the best tools for sharing visual feedback, managing web design projects that are going on, finding bugs and fixing them, and iterating on designs without any hassle.

Developers and designers can use this tool to sync their intentions, improve user interfaces and designs, and ensure a smooth transition from design to development.

This tool grants webmasters and designers a broad range of collaborative tools. This is the right tool, especially for teams that seek to optimize their design workflows and improve collaboration, with its visual interface, real-time collaboration tools, and design-specific features.

### Pros of Using Webvizio:

* **Collaboration with seamless visuals**. It enables users to add annotations right on top of visuals and forward on problems, or they can upload screenshots and add comments to web pages to give contextual feedback, improve clarity, and reduce mistakes.  

* **Managing tasks efficiently**. With this tool, users can assign tasks, define deadlines, track productivity, and monitor the project progress effortlessly. This is useful to project managers and web developers for managing the workloads of their teams.

### Cons of Using Webvizio:

* **Problems with email invitations**. There have been some reports of users experiencing difficulties accepting email invitations while using this tool, possibly because the invitations did not arrive in their inboxes. Several clients who are less tech-savvy have reported this issue.  

* **Viewing multi-page PDFs is inconvenient**. Several users have complained about the way that Webvizio displays multi-page PDFs. Reviewers have criticized the lack of a scrollable side-by-side page layout, which appears as a separate tab instead of a side-by-side layout.
