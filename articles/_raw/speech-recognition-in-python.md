Speech recognition allows software to recognize speech within audio and convert it into text. There are many interesting use-cases for speech recognition and it is easier than you may think to add it your own applications.

We just published a course on the freeCodeCamp.org YouTube channel that will teach you how to implement speech recognition in Python by building 5 projects.

Misra Turp & Patrick Loeber teach this course. Patrick is an experienced software engineer and Mirsra is an experienced data scientist. And they are both developer advocates at Assembly AI.

Assembly AI is a deep learning company that creates a speech-to-text API. You will learn how to use the API in this course. Assembly AI provided a grant that made this course possible.

In the **first project** you will learn the basics of audio processing by learning how to record audio from a microphone with pyaudio and write it to a wave file. You will also learn how to plot the sound waves with matplotlib.

In the **second project** you will learn how to implement simple speech recognition. You will learn how to use the AssemblyAI API and how to work with APIs with the requests module.

In the **third project** you will learn how to perform sentiment analysis on iPhone reviews from YouTube. You will learn how to use youtube-dl and how to implement sentiment classification.

In the **fourth project** you will write a program that will create automatic summarizations of podcasts using the Listen Notes API and Streamlit.

In the **final project** you will create a voice assistant with real-time speech recognition using websockets and the OpenAI API.

Watch the full course below or [on the freeCodeCamp.org YouTube channel](https://youtu.be/mYUyaKmvu6Y) (2-hour watch).
