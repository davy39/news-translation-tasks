We just posted a new course on the freeCodeCamp.org YouTube channel that is designed to help you master the creation of RESTful APIs using Next.js 14, a popular React framework. Umair Jameel developed this course.

Next.js is a framework built on top of React that allows developers to create optimized web applications. It provides features like server-side rendering, static site generation, and API routes, making it a powerful tool for building both frontend and backend functionalities in a single project.

CRUD stands for Create, Read, Update, and Delete. These are the four basic operations you can perform on data. In the context of our course, you will learn how to implement these operations in REST APIs using Next.js. Each operation corresponds to an HTTP method:

* **Create** (POST): Add new data to the database.
    
* **Read** (GET): Retrieve data from the database.
    
* **Update** (PATCH): Modify existing data in the database.
    
* **Delete** (DELETE): Remove data from the database.
    

This comprehensive course covers everything you need to know to build robust REST APIs. Here are the sections in this course:

* Overview of project
    
* Create new next.js project
    
* Files and folder structure
    
* Connect to database
    
* Create user schema
    
* GET users api
    
* POST new user api
    
* PATCH user api
    
* DELETE user api
    
* Create category schema
    
* GET categories api
    
* POST category api
    
* PATCH category api
    
* DELETE category api
    
* Create blog schema
    
* GET blogs api
    
* POST blog api
    
* GET single blog api
    
* PATCH blog api
    
* DELETE blog api
    
* Search blogs api with keywords
    
* Filter blogs with date
    
* Sort blogs api
    
* Blogs pagination
    
* Protect api routes
    
* Logging middleware
    
* Deployment
    

This course is perfect for developers looking to enhance their skills in API development using modern technologies. By the end of this course, you will have a solid understanding of how to create, secure, and deploy RESTful APIs with Next.js 14.
