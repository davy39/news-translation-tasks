Are you having trouble finding the perfect WordPress theme? Try making one yourself!

We posted a course on the freeCodeCamp.org YouTube channel that will teach you how to create a custom WordPress theme. You will learn a process that you can use to convert any HTML/CSS template into a WordPress theme.

In this free course, Andrew Wilson shows every step to create a WordPress theme. He will show you everything from what files and folders are required to how to make your own 404 page.

The theme you create in this course will be fully-responsive. It includes a home page, sliders, navigation, comments with nested comments, static blog pages, an archive page, a contact us page, and more.

WordPress themes are a hierarchy of template parts. A WordPress theme takes all those parts and splits them up into individual files.  In this course, you will learn how to create all parts of the hierarchy. 

You can watch the full course below or [on the freeCodeCamp.org YouTube channel](https://youtu.be/-h7gOJbIpmo).
