"Any application that can be written in JavaScript, will eventually be written in JavaScript." – Jeff Atwood

It's time for you to create a self-driving car using JavaScript!

We just published a course on the freeCodeCamp.org YouTube channel that will help you learn about neural networks by teaching you how to build a self-driving car simulator in JavaScript (with no libraries!).

Radu Mariescu-Istodor developed this course. Radu has a PhD in computer science and is known for creating creative tutorials relating to machine learning and programming.

In this course you will learn how to implement the car driving mechanics, how to define the environment, how to simulate some sensors, how to detect collisions, and how to make the car control itself using a neural network.

The course covers how artificial neural networks work, by comparing them with the real neural networks in our brain. You will learn how to implement a neural network and how to visualize it so we can see it in action.

Radu uses JavaScript to implement the system and he teaches modern JavaScript techniques. This course is perfect for people interested in becoming software engineers or machine learning specialists (like Radu – he has over 10 years research experience with machine learning).

Here are the sections covered in this course:

* Car driving mechanics
* Defining the road
* Artificial sensors
* Collision detection
* Simulating traffic
* Neural network
* Parallelization
* Genetic algorithm

Watch the full course below or [on the freeCodeCamp.org YouTube channel](https://youtu.be/Rs_rAxEsAvI) (2.5-hour watch).
