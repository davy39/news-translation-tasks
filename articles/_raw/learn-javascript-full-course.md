This complete 134-part JavaScript course for beginners will teach you everything you need to know to get started with the JavaScript programming language. The font-size in this course is large, making it perfect for viewing on small screens.

I created this course to go along with the freeCodeCamp.org JavaScript curriculum. However, the course works on its own so going through the free curriculum at [freeCodeCamp.org](https://freecodecamp.org) is not required.

By then end of this course, you will be ready to start using JavaScript to create your own projects.

You can watch the video on the [the freeCodeCamp.org YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkZNo7MFNFg) (3.5 hour watch).‌
