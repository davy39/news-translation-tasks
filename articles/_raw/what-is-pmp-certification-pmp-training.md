PMP certification is type of a project management certification offered by the Project Management Institute (PMI). It is globally recognized. Many experts in the project management field consider PMP certification to be a "gold standard".

PMP stands for Project Management Professional. It's a designation awarded by PMI to people who successfully complete the PMP exam. 

The exam tests your knowledge and understanding of the project management framework and how to apply it in a real-world setting. 

This is only one of the 8 certifications offered by PMI, and is often the first certification a project manager will get. Some other popular certifications include:

* The Certified Associate in Project Management (CAPM)
* The PMI-ACP (Agile Certified Practitioner)
* and the PMI-PBA (Professional in Business Analysis)

### What is the history of the PMI?

The Project Management Institute (PMI) is a global professional association for project managers. PMI was founded in 1969 and is headquartered in Newtown Square, Pennsylvania, United States.

### Who is eligible for PMP certification?

To be eligible for PMP certification, you must have a minimum of 4,500 hours of project management experience and a high school diploma (or equivalent, such as a GED in the US). You must also pass the PMP exam.

### Is the PMP exam hard?

The PMP exam is considered to be challenging, but not impossible. If you are well-prepared and have a strong understanding of the project management framework, you stand a good chance of success.

### Is PMP certification equivalent to a degree?

PMP certification is not equivalent to a degree. A degree typically requires a greater time and financial investment than certification. 

This said, both a degree and a certification can demonstrate your knowledge and expertise in project management.

### What are the Benefits of PMP Certification Training?

There are many benefits to PMP certification training. PMP certification is globally recognized and demonstrates that you have the experience and education to lead and manage projects. 

PMP certification also gives you access to a network of other certified project managers who can provide support and guidance, and it can help you earn a higher salary.

### Is it worth getting a PMP certification?

There is no one-size-fits-all answer to whether or not PMP certification is worth it. It depends on factors such as your career goals, work experience, and employer's expectations. However, in general, PMP certification can be beneficial in terms of career advancement and earning potential. 

The certification is globally recognized and can help you advance their career in project management.

## What are the Different Types of PMP Certification Training?

There are several different types of PMP certification training available to help you prepare for the PMP certification exam. You can find online courses, in-person courses, and online practice exams, among other resources. 

The type of training you choose should be based on your learning style and the time you have available to prepare for the exam.

* **Online Courses**: Online PMP certification training courses are convenient and allow you to learn at your own pace. You can usually find online courses in a variety of formats, including video, audio, and text. You can also find online practice exams to help you prepare for the actual exam.
* **In-Person Courses**: In-person PMP certification training courses are often more expensive than online courses, but they offer the benefit of being able to attend live lectures and get feedback from instructors. You can also get more hands-on experience with the material than you would from an online course.
* **Online Practice Exams**: Online practice exams are a great way to prepare for the actual exam. These exams are usually based on the PMP exam content outline. They can help you identify your strengths and weaknesses. You can also find online practice exams that are specific to the type of PMP certification you are pursuing.

There are also schools that provide training for the exam. And you may be able to find some free learning resources and YouTube channels.

### Does freeCodeCamp.org offer PMP Certification Training?

Not yet. We may explore this in the future. For now, I recommend shopping around for courses through those providers I mentioned earlier.

If you are serious about becoming a PMP, know that it takes several years of hard work and study.
