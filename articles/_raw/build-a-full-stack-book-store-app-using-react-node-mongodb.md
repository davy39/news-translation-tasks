Building fullstack web applications is one of the most valuable skills in modern web development. If you're looking for a project that can take you through the complete development process—from setting up the front end to managing a robust back end—this is the perfect course for you.

We just published a course on the [freeCodeCamp.org](http://freeCodeCamp.org) YouTube channel that will teach you all about building a comprehensive fullstack MERN stack bookstore website. In this course, you'll learn to work with the MERN stack, which includes **MongoDB** for the database, **Express.js** and **Node.js** for the backend, and **React** for the frontend. Along the way, you'll also integrate powerful tools like **Tailwind CSS** for responsive design, **Redux** and **RTK Query Toolkit** for state management, **Mongoose** for handling MongoDB queries, and **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)** for authentication.

The project begins with setting up a bookstore website that allows users to browse books, add them to their cart, and place orders through a cash-on-delivery system. You'll create a responsive, user-friendly frontend using React and Tailwind CSS. The course also covers important ecommerce features like inventory management, where users can add and remove books from their carts and proceed to checkout.

For admins, the course guides you through building a secure admin dashboard where books can be managed efficiently. Admins can log in using a secure username and password, upload new books, edit existing book details, and delete entries when necessary. This not only adds real-world complexity to your application but also teaches you how to handle user roles and permissions—an important skill in fullstack development.

### Key Highlights of the Course:

* **Frontend Development**: You'll use **React** to build a dynamic, responsive user interface for your bookstore. From creating reusable components to building a navigation bar, product display sections, and a cart system, you'll cover all the essential aspects of a modern web application's front end.
    
* **Backend Development**: Learn to set up a **Node.js** server with **Express.js** and handle data storage with **MongoDB**. You'll define schemas using **Mongoose**, create API routes for books and orders, and integrate user authentication with **JWT**.
    
* **State Management**: Discover how to manage the application's state effectively using **Redux** and **RTK Query Toolkit**, ensuring a seamless user experience as data flows between the frontend and backend.
    
* **Authentication & Security**: Secure the bookstore with **JWT-based authentication**. Implement private routes to restrict admin functionalities and ensure only authorized users can manage the inventory.
    
* **Admin Dashboard**: Build a full-featured admin panel for adding, editing, and deleting books. You'll learn how to manage this secure section of the site and ensure it operates smoothly.
    
* **Deployment**: The course concludes with guidance on deploying your MERN stack project, so you can make your bookstore live and accessible to the world.
    

This project will help you build a fully functional MERN stack application from scratch. You'll start with setting up the project and installing essential dependencies like **React Router DOM** for navigation, **Redux** for state management, and **RTK Query** for data fetching. You'll then move into creating individual features like a responsive navbar, a book display system, a cart page, and a checkout system.
