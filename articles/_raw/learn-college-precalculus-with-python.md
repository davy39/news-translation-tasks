Precalculus is an important mathematical course that lays the groundwork for calculus and other higher-level math subjects.

We just released a college precalculus course on the freeCodeCamp.org YouTube channel. This course is unique in that you will also learn to implement the concepts using the Python programming language. This course is ideal for students gearing up for college-level mathematics or anyone looking to strengthen their understanding of precalculus.

Ed Pratowski developed this course. He is an experienced mathematics instructor at a University in Pennsylvania.

Precalculus covers a variety of topics such as functions, trigonometry, matrices, and complex numbers. A solid grasp of precalculus is essential for success in fields like engineering, physics, computer science, and more.

In this course, you'll gain a deep understanding of essential precalculus concepts. Here’s a brief overview of what you’ll learn:

* **Data Analysis and Graphing:** Learn to gather, interpret, and graph data effectively.
    
* **Linear Equations:** Understand how to draw and analyze lines, slopes, and intercepts.
    
* **Trigonometry:** Dive into the basics of trigonometry, solve right triangles, and explore degrees, radians, and the unit circle.
    
* **Trigonometric Functions:** Graph the six trigonometric functions, transform these graphs, and apply trigonometry to real-world problems.
    
* **Triangles:** Master the Law of Sines and Cosines, calculate the area of any triangle, and solve triangles from given points.
    
* **Matrices:** Perform operations with matrices, including addition, subtraction, multiplication, and finding inverses. Use matrices to solve systems of equations and develop equations.
    
* **Complex Numbers and Series:** Understand complex numbers, graph the Mandelbrot set, and explore series, including the number e.
    
* **Probability and Applications:** Learn probability theory, Pascal's triangle, and the math behind gambling.
    
* **Practical Applications:** Apply trigonometry to build a clock, encode and decode messages, and more.
    
* **Advanced Topics:** Simplify trigonometric expressions and discover Euler's identity, known as the beautiful math formula.
    

This course offers clear explanations and practical examples to ensure you grasp these foundational concepts. Watch the full course on [the freeCodeCamp.org YouTube channel](https://youtu.be/Y8oZtFYweTY) (12-hour watch).
