NestJS is a progressive Node.js framework for building efficient and reliable server-side applications. It uses TypeScript by default and encourages clean, modular code with concepts including controllers, services, and dependency injection.

We just published a NestJS course on the freeCodeCamp.org YouTube channel that will help you harness it’s modular architecture, TypeScript support, and built-in tools to create clean, testable, code.

In this course, you'll explore controllers, services, modules, decorators, pipes, guards, and exception handling - all while building the profile feature for DevMatch, a dating app for developers.

You’ll implement profile creation, updates, and data retrieval while exploring the full lifecycle of a NestJS backend. By the end, you’ll have a solid foundation in NestJS fundamentals, plus the confidence to apply these skills to your own APIs and applications.

The course covers:

* Understand NestJS fundamentals: modules, decorators, and structure.
    
* Build controllers to handle GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE requests.
    
* Connect controllers to services to manage application logic.
    
* Implement validation and transformation with pipes.
    
* Handle errors gracefully with exception filters.
    
* Use guards to manage application security and access control.
    
* Solve hands-on challenges that reinforce each concept.
    

Watch the full course on the [freeCodeCamp.org YouTube channel](https://youtu.be/21_I-12f5JE) (2-hour watch).
