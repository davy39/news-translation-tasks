With CSS Flexbox, you can easily create responsive websites that adapt to different screen sizes and devices. It's an essential skill for any modern web developer.

If you have Spanish-speaking friends, you are welcome to share the **[Spanish version of this article](https://www.freecodecamp.org/espanol/news/aprende-css-flexbox-desde-cero-curso-paso-a-paso)** with them.

Are you ready? Let's see a quick overview of Flexbox and what you will learn during the course.

## **What is** CSS **Flexbox**?****

CSS Flexbox stands for CSS Flexible Box Layout. It's a layout model that allows responsive elements to be rearranged within a container based on CSS properties that define how the children should "move" to fit the size of their container.

With Flexbox, you can align, distribute, and space elements using simple properties, so you can avoid complex computations in your CSS.

During the course, you will learn how to use these properties:

* `**flex-direction**`
* `**justify-content**`
* `**flex-wrap**`
* `**align-items**`
* `**align-content**`
* `**flex-grow**`
* `**flex-basis**`
* `**flex-shrink**`

And more! You will also learn how to combine them with media queries to create even more powerful responsive layouts.
