## Solution 1: Check the Computer for Overheating

These days, computers are programmed to shut down after heating up to a certain temperature. This is a safety measure because damage to both hardware and software components can occur if your machine gets too hot.

If your Windows 10 PC shuts down abruptly, the first thing I would recommend you do is to check if it's overheating. 

Overheating could be due to damaged or underperforming fans, poor ventilation, dust, and inadequate power supply.

What I would recommend you do is clean your computer, make sure the room in which you're working is well ventilated, use a stable power source, and elevate your laptop if some parts of the fan are on the under side.

## Solution 2: Turn off Fast Startup

Windows 10 is optimized for fast recovery from sleep, shutdown, and hibernation. This feature can hamper performance and cause random shutdowns if not turned off.

The step below show you how to turn off fast startup on Windows 10:

**Step 1**: Launch the Control Panel by pressing the `WIN` button on your keyboard, typing "control panel" (without quotes), and hitting `ENTER` to open up the first search result.

**Step 2**: Change the view mode of the Control Panel to large icons.

## Solution 3: Update Outdated Drivers and GPU Driver

Outdated drivers could be the culprit when your PC randomly shuts down. 

To update any driver, open Device Manager by right-clicking on Start and selecting "Device Manager". 

Expand the devices one by one by one, right-click on each of them, and select "Update driver".

If you can't cope with the hassle of updating drivers one by one, check online for services that let you search for the outdated driver on your PC and update them automatically.

As far as the Graphics Processing Unit driver is concerned, you might not get the necessary update by updating it like you update other drivers. 

Instead of doing that, you should check the manufacturer's website and download updates from there.

The best way to update a GPU driver is explained below:

**Step 1**: Right-click on Start and select Device Manager.

**Step 2**: Expand Display adapters.

**Step 3**: Right-click on your display adapter and select Properties.

**Step 4**: Switch to the Details tab and click the "Device description" drop-down, then choose Hardware Ids.

**Step 6**: Open your browser, paste in the ID, and search for it. The first few search results will show the exact name and manufacturer of your GPU.

**Step 7**: Navigate to the website of the GPU manufacturer and download an updated driver.

**Step 8**: Install the driver and restart your PC

**P.S.**: If you can’t find the official website of the manufacturer, copy the name displayed for your GPU and prefix it with “driver update for”. In my case, this would be “driver update for Intel(R) HD Graphics 520 drivers / HP HP EliteBook 840 G3“.

## Solution 4: Scan your Computer for Viruses

Some malware and viruses do cause your computer to abruptly shut down.

What you should do in this case is run a full system scan with Windows Security (aka Windows Defender), or any third-party antivirus program of your choice.

The steps below explain how you can conduct a full system scan with Windows Security:

**Step 1**: Press the `WIN` key on your keyboard and search for "windows security". The first search result should be Windows Security. Hit `ENTER` to open it.

**Step 2**: Switch to the Virus & Threat Protection tab on the left.

**Step 3**: Click the "Scan Options" link.

**Step 4**: Choose Full scan and click Scan now.

**P.S**: This could take many hours, so be patient with it.
