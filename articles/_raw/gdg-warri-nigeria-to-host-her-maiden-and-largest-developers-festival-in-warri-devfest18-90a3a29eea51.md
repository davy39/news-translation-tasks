Inspired by the shared vision of community building through technology, the [GDG Warri Nigeria](https://www.meetup.com/GDG-Warri) will, on October 6, 2018, host hundreds of developers (and aspiring developers) in a historic event — #DevFestWarri, a first of it’s kind in the city of Warri, Delta State, South of Nigeria.

#DevFestWarri will feature a variety of tech sessions — Web, Machine Learning, Diversity and Inclusion in Tech — which will suit the needs of every attendee!

If you are within the city of Warri, Delta State or South of Nigeria, and you are a developer (or aspiring), AI/ML enthusiast, a tech enthusiast, or even fascinated by technology, then you should [RSVP here for a FREE entry ticket](https://www.meetup.com/GDG-Warri/events/253573754/)! You can join us for #DevFestWarri on Saturday October 6, 2018 at the Dandani hall, 128 Airport Road, Effurun-Warri, Delta State.

#### What is DevFest?

> DevFests are community-led, developer events hosted by GDG chapters around the globe focused on community building and learning about technologies. Each DevFest is inspired by and uniquely tailored to the needs of the developer community and region that hosts it. — [DevFest Official Website](https://devfest.withgoogle.com/)

#### Why you should attend?

What began this year in Warri, as a [small community of developers](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/how-i-started-a-google-developers-group-gdg-chapter-in-warri-nigeria-and-reached-100-members-22cbd622d070) — [the GDG Warri](https://www.meetup.com/GDG-Warri/) — coming together for meetups has grown into a 440+ active membership strength. We’re now hosting the first and the largest developers festival in Delta State, Nigeria.

Attending the #DevFestWarri will inspire you to push beyond your limits, as you will be drawing on the wealth of knowledge being shared by some of the most amazing tech leaders and developers within the wider tech community.

You will meet other individuals with similar interests, and you’ll get to network and share knowledge. And perhaps you’ll even start the friendships that will not only make amazing things happen but also provide technological solutions to some of our local (and even global) challenges.

You will be inspired and you should attend!
