Wepback is a JavaScript module bundler and is useful in many development workflows. Learn Webpack from Colt Steele in this full course.

The course begins with a simple question: "What is webpack?"  Then you will learn about installing Webpack, configuring it, and adding loaders for CSS, SASS, HTML, and Files. 

The course covers cache busting, setting up a dev server, and splitting up your development and production config files. You will learn about multiple Webpack plugins including clean-webpack-plugin, mini-css-extract-plugin,  optimize-css-assets-webpack-plugin, terser-webpack-plugin, and html-webpack-plugin.

You can watch the full video course on the [freeCodeCamp.org YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpGLUVbqoYQ) (2 hour watch).
