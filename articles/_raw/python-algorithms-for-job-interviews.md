During software job interviews, candidates often have to solve algorithm challenges. In this video from CupOfCode01, you will learn about common algorithm concepts in Python and how to solve algorithm challenges you may encounter in an interview.

Here are some of the topics you'll learn from this video:

* Big O Notation
* Array Sequences
* Dynamic Arrays
* Array Algorithms
* Array Analysis
* How to build a Minesweeper game

You will learn all about Big O Notation. You will also learn how to solve common algorithm challenges featuring strings, arrays, and more. 

This should help you make sure you're all prepared for your next job interview.

You can watch the full video on the [freeCodeCamp.org YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p65AHm9MX80) (4 hour watch).
