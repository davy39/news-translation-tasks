To keep your Excel data safe from unwanted editing and tampering, you might want to lock the cells and protect the worksheet.

Fortunately, Excel is a highly customizable data analysis tool which lets you lock cells and protect your worksheets with a password at the same time.

In this guide, I will show you how to lock cells and password-protect a worksheet in Excel. 

## How to Lock All Cells in Excel

By default, all cells are locked in Excel, but this isn't really efficient until the sheet is protected. 

To verify that all cells are locked, press `Ctrl + A` to select all cells.

Right-click anywhere within the selection and click “Format Cells”

You can see all cells are locked by default.

## How to Protect the Worksheet

To make this cell locking effective, you need to protect the worksheet. 

To protect the worksheet, click the Review tab and select “Protect Sheet”.

**N.B.:** If you don’t enter a password, anyone can unlock the sheet and tamper with your data.

## How to Lock Specific Cells in Excel

**First, you need to unlock all cells.**

By default, all cells are locked in Excel, as I discussed above. So, the first thing you have to do in order to lock certain cells is to unlock all cells.

To unlock all cells, press `Ctrl + A` to select all cells.

Remember that locking cells is not effective until you protect the worksheet. So, go through [the processes for protecting the worksheet](#heading-how-to-protect-the-worksheet) again.

Now, if anyone tries to edit any of the cells, Excel will tell them it’s protected.
