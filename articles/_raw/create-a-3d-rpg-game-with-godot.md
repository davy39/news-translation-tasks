Embark on a journey through the realms of 3D game development with a new video course on the freeCodeCamp.org YouTube channel.

Designed by the experienced game developer Omar Zaki, this course will help you master the creation of a 3D Action Role-Playing Game (RPG) with the open source Godot engine. 

Whether you’re dipping your toes into game development for the first time, or you’re a veteran developer looking to sharpen your skills, this course has something for everyone.

## Setting The Foundations

The course begins by laying a strong foundation. You’ll start by downloading and importing the assets necessary for building your game. All the assets are available for free.

With a wealth of textures, models, and sounds at your disposal, you’ll be geared up to craft a captivating virtual environment.

## Crafting Your Virtual World

Next, Omar guides you through the essentials of creating a dynamic 3D world. You’ll learn how to set up and manipulate the camera, which is pivotal to how players will experience your game. 

You'll also dive into GridMap, a powerful tool for level design, to construct elaborate and engaging environments.

## Animating Your Characters

A significant portion of the course is dedicated to breathing life into your characters. From establishing basic animations like walking to setting up complex animation trees with various states, you’ll learn how to create characters that are lifelike and responsive.

## Elements of Adventure: Torches, Particles and AI Monsters

What's an RPG without atmospheric elements and formidable foes? You'll learn to create torches with realistic flames using particle systems, adding depth to your environments. 

But it’s not just the atmosphere you’ll be focusing on. You’ll also venture into creating AI systems for monsters, ensuring your game provides the thrills players seek.

## Managing Inventories and Equipment

No RPG is complete without an inventory system. Omar goes in-depth in teaching you how to create an inventory, enable interactions, and manage equipment.

## Shop Interaction and Saving Progress

You’ll also delve into the nuances of creating shop interactions, learning how to design shop UI and scripts for buying items. You'll also learn the indispensable skill of saving and loading inventory, ensuring that players can pick up right where they left off.

## Wrapping Up

Finally, the course will guide you through cleaning up the UI and polishing your game. Omar concludes the course with final thoughts and advice for aspiring game developers.
