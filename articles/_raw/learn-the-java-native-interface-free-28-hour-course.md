The Java Native Interface allows Java code to call native libraries written in C and C++. It is helpful when you need to do something that cannot be accomplished with Java alone.

We just released a massive 28-Hour course on the freeCodeCamp.org YouTube channel that will take you from beginner to expert with the Java Native Interface.

This course is from Java for Engineers. They have created a bunch of high-quality Java tutorials.

Here are all the section covered in this comprehensive course.
