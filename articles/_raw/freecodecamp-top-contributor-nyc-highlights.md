Saturday night in New York City, the freeCodeCamp team hosted a party to recognize top open source contributors within our community.

* Jennifer Bland, a developer who has authored a number of videos and articles for freeCodeCamp
* Stuart Taylor, who re-architected freeCodeCamp's new learning platform and coded the freeCodeCamp Guide
* Bill Sourour, who has been programming for more than 20 years and built projects for many major Canandian companies and government agencies
