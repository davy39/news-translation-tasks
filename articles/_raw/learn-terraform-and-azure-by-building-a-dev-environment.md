Terraform is an open source infrastructure as code software tool that makes it easy to programmatically to set up infrastructure on a variety of cloud service providers.

We just published a course on the freeCodeCamp.org YouTube channel that will teach you how to use Terraform and Azure to setup a development environment.

We previously posted a similar course with AWS instead of Azure.

Derek Morgan created this course. He has created a bunch of courses to prepare students for a variety of technical certifications.

This course is designed to help you learn the basics of Terraform fast with a hands-on project that can serve as a framework for your own projects!

This project will guide you through Terraform basics as you utilize Visual Studio Code (on Windows, Mac, or Linux!) to deploy Azure resources and an Azure VM that you can SSH into to have your own redeployable environment that will be perfect for your own future projects!

Here are the sections covered in this course:

* Welcome and Setup
* Terraform Provider Init
* A Resource Group
* A Virtual Network and Referencing other Resources 
* Terraform State
* Terraform Destroy
* A Subnet
* A Security Group
* Security Group Associations
* A Public IP
* A Network Interface
* A Key Pair
* Custom Data
* SSH Config Scripts
* The Provisioner
* Data Sources
* Outputs
* Variables
* Variable Precedence
* Conditionals

Watch the full course below or on [the freeCodeCamp.org YouTube channel](https://youtu.be/iRaai1IBlB0) (2-hour watch).
