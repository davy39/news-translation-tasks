Every computer has a graphics card that handles the rendering of every pixel you see on the monitor. This graphics card also plays a crucial role in displaying videos, running applications, and most especially, handling video game graphics. 

Computers also have a graphics processing unit (GPU), which renders images and videos. Your computer has a GPU from either Intel, AMD, or NVIDIA. 

If your computer doesn’t have a graphics card with a powerful GPU, you might be unable to play the latest games, run infographics, and use video-intensive apps. And certain apps might not render correctly.
