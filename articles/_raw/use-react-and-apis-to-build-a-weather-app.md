A weather application is a very common beginner's programming project. But you can take this basic project to the next level by incorporating multiple APIs and autocomplete of places.

We just published a course on the freeCodeCamp.org YouTube channel that will help you improve your React skills by guiding you through the creation of a weather app with autocomplete.

Slobodan Gajic created this course. Slobodan is a senior frontend developer and he is a great teacher.

In this course, you will learn how to create a places/cities autocomplete using the GeoDB API and how to use the OpenWeatherMap API in React. You will also learn how to use Promise.all and async/await.

Here are the sections in this course:

* How to get API keys
* Creating the application and installing packages
* Building city search component
* Building current weather component
* Fetching and mapping data from weather API
* Building weather forecast component

Watch the full course below or on the [freeCodeCamp.org YouTube channel](https://youtu.be/Reny0cTTv24) (2-hour watch).
