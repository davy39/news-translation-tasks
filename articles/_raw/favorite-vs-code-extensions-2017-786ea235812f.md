Here is a list of some extensions I come to enjoy with Visual Studio Code (VSCode). Since I work a lot in the front-end, most of these extensions will be useful for web developers. I have been working previously with Atom, Visual Studio and Webstorm but VSCode suits me best and is just incredible. The developer did a great job ( and still do! ). Try it for yourself and enjoy!
