There are many tutorials that cover one specific technology but it can sometimes be difficult to figure out how all the technologies fit together. We just [posted a video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JgwI22y_eFA) on the freeCodeCamp.org YouTube channel that will take you from start to finish in building an online store.

In this course, Manoj Fernando will show you how to use AWS, React, and Stripe to build a book store. The project uses Amplify, AppSync, DynamoDB, S3, Lambda services in AWS and React Hooks, and the Context API in ReactJS. You will learn how all these technologies work together.

You will learn how to create an AppSnyc API as a GraphQL API and create S3 buckets to store book images. Manoj does not cover every single line of the React code but focusses on connecting to AWS from React. He also coveres the different database relationships needed to create the project and how to implement different authorization levels. Finally, he shows how to create the checkout page with payment processing. All the code used is included.

Here are the topics covered in this course:

* Product Demo
* Architecture Diagram Discussion
* Setting up the Project
* Initializing an Amplify Project
* Adding Authentication with Cognito
* Create an S3 Bucket to Store Images
* Create Lambda Functions to Process Order (Pipeline Resolver)
* Creating Cloud Resources 
* Processing Book Orders
* Running the Application
* Connecting to Cloud Resources from React App
* Verifying Customer Orders
* Hosting the Site on S3
