If you are a web-application developer looking to learn how to leverage the cloud or want to become a cloud developer, the ExamPro Cloud Development Environment (EXP-CDE-01) is the first step.

## What is a Cloud Developer Environment? 

A Cloud Developer Environment (CDE) is a:

*  code editor that can run in the cloud and
*  the underlying compute environment runs in the cloud.

This is different from traditional environments, which run on your local machine and uses your local computing power.

A Cloud Developer Environment has many advantages:

* All you need a web-browser and an internet connection
* Very easy to remotely collaborate in the same environment within a team
* Reduce developer environment configuration for new team members
* Well suited towards cloud technologies which require vastly different environments based on the use-case
* and more...

## What is the ExamPro Cloud Developer Environment Certification (EXP-CDE-01)? 

This cloud certification is designed to teach you how to leverage a Cloud Developer Environment for Web Developer, Cloud Developer or Cloud Engineer roles.

Acquiring knowledge about Cloud Developer Environments is the first and essential step towards becoming a Cloud Developer.

This certification is **also known as the Gitpod Certification**, because it strongly focuses on using the open-source and Software as Service (SaaS) known as Gitpod.

The reason Gitpod was chosen was because:

* It's has a generous free-tier
* It's open-source (MIT license)
* It's vendor agnostic, (can work with Gitlab, Github, Bitbucket)
* It's Code Editor is Visual Studio Code, the most popular code editor
* It is the market leader for Cloud Developer Environments

Cloud Developer Environments (CDE) have very similar feature sets so CDE concepts learned on Gitpod will translate to other CDEs.

### What is an ExamPro Certification?

ExamPro is the company thats produced multiple free video study courses published to freeCodeCamp YouTube for popular Cloud Service Providers eg. AWS, Azure, GCP, Kubernetes for certifications such as the: CLF-C01, SAA-C02, SOA-C01, DVA-C01, AZ-900, DP-900, AI-900, AZ-104, GCP-CDL, the KCNA and more.

ExamPro is producing its own cloud certification that aligns to specific cloud roles. ExamPro is the issuing authority and intends to sharply reduce the cost of cloud certifications to make cloud knowledge more accessible.

## What is a Cloud Developer?

A Cloud Developer is a web-application developer role that incorporates cloud-services when building web-applications.

Cloud Developers can make **30% more** than web-application developers because cloud-developers know how to take full-advantage of the cloud.

So web-applications built by cloud developers will be are more available, scalable, durable, secure and allows small organizations to compete in the global market against established tech giants.

The term cloud developer is becoming popularized, many job postings that are asking for web developers or full-stack developers are actually cloud developer roles. 

## Is it is hard to become a Cloud Developer?

A Cloud Developer's skill set is similar to a Web-Application Developer however much of the web-application's functionality can be offloaded to cloud-services.

So a Cloud Developer has needs to the following knowledge:

* **Cloud Developer Environments** - have a specialized ephemeral developer environment suited for working with many different kind of SDKs and development tools
* **Cloud Programming** - broader knowledge of multiple programming languages, since cloud-services SDKs language availability vary per service
* **Application Integration** - Cloud services needs to be integrated into your web-application or communicate with other services. A cloud developer writes code or configuration to integrates these together
* **Cloud Deployment** - A cloud developer has the added responsibility of understanding how deployment pipelines work in a cloud environment

A cloud developer strongly benefits from having knowledge of the underlying infrastructure and architecture to which their application will be deployed. However a Cloud Developer is not responsible for for the lifecycle, automation or maintain of the infrastructure.

A Cloud developer benefits from knowing the following about cloud infrastructure:

* **Virtualization** — The most common place to run a web-application is on a virtual machine and virtual environments is the basis for modern architecture such as containers and serverless.
* **Linux** — The most common operation system to run web-application servers, A Cloud developer needs to know basic Linux networking, linux troubleshooting
* **Windows** — Windows Server is very common in traditional IT, and having general windows knowledge alongside Linux allows a Cloud Developer to maximize the use of cloud services that run on Windows.
* **Containers** — The next step up from Virtual Machines, Containers allow for additional portability and isolation, and encourage micro-service architecture which is more aligned with cloud services.
* **Serverless** — A modern architecture where developers can focus on code, and everything else is handled by the cloud provider.
