Learning a new language can open doors to new cultures, connections, and opportunities, and Spanish is one of the most widely spoken languages in the world. Whether you're dreaming of traveling to Spanish-speaking countries, connecting with Spanish-speaking communities, or simply expanding your linguistic skills, taking the first step can be the hardest part. But with the right guidance and a structured, engaging approach, mastering the basics becomes an enjoyable and rewarding experience.

We just published a course on the [freeCodeCamp.org](http://freeCodeCamp.org) YouTube channel that will teach you all about beginner-level Spanish using the highly regarded textbook *Aula Internacional 1*. This comprehensive, step-by-step course is designed specifically for complete beginners and aligns with the A1 level of the Common European Framework of Reference for Languages (CEFR).

Taught entirely in Spanish to immerse you from the start, this course provides a solid foundation in essential vocabulary, grammar, and conversational skills, making it ideal for anyone starting their language-learning journey. Virginia teaches this A1 level coruse. She is a certified Spanish teacher with 16 years experience teaching Spanish.

The course is divided into easy-to-follow segments that guide you through real-life topics and practical language use. You'll start with basic introductions and learn fundamental verbs like *ser*, *tener*, and *llamarse*. As you progress, you'll explore important grammatical structures such as the present tense, articles, prepositions, and the differences between *ser*, *estar*, and *hay*. The course also covers essential everyday topics including the weather, colors, shopping, describing people, family, food, and navigating your neighborhood.

Beyond vocabulary and grammar, the course emphasizes real-world communication. You'll practice using demonstratives like *esto* and *este*, learn how to use verbs like *gustar*, and get comfortable with reflexive and irregular verbs. Later lessons introduce quantifiers, personality adjectives, and even dip into the *pretérito perfecto*, which is a stepping stone into past tenses.

Whether you're learning for travel, work, or personal growth, this Spanish course offers an accessible and thorough path into the language.
