In this intermediate React course from Karl Hadwen, you will learn how to create the popular Todoist application from scratch using React, Custom Hooks, Firebase & the React Testing Library. You will lean how to use SCSS to style the application and how to use the BEM naming methodology.

This application is fully responsive. You will see how to use Lighthouse (Chrome extension) to make sure your website is fully accessible by getting all accessibility features integrated into our application.

First, you will see how to initialize the application using create-react-app as the base. Then, you will learn how to build out the application using React (Custom Hooks, Context), Firebase & the React Testing Library (unit & integration testing). You will even lean how to add dark mode!

You can watch the [full video course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hT3j87FMR6M) on the freeCodeCamp.org YouTube channel (8 hour watch).
