### Happy International Women’s Day!

### Thought of the day:

> “With software there are only two possibilities: either the users control the program or the program controls the users. If the program controls the users, and the developer controls the program, then the program is an instrument of unjust power.” — Richard Stallman, creator of the GNU Project

### Funny of the day:
