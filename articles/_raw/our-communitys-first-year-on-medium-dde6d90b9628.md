About one year ago, we shut down our open source community’s blog and moved everyone over to Medium.

* **214 contributors**
* have published **460 stories**
* which have each been viewed an **average of 17,000 times**.

_Our community’s publication now gets more than a million views per month._

Half of all the stories we’ve published have been viewed at least 5,000 times.

_An average of nearly 27,000 people visit our community’s Medium publication every day._

Over 12 months, our community publication — which focuses on development, design, and data science — has become the [12th largest Medium publication](https://toppub.xyz/), and the largest technical one.

_Readers spent more than 7 million minutes reading our publication over the past 3 months._

How did our community’s publication manage to grow so quickly?

### Reason #1: Deep thinkers who are good at writing

Hundreds of developers, designers, and data scientists — who share our vision of open source education — have published stories here.

[Adrian](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/our-communitys-first-year-on-medium-dde6d90b9628/undefined) shared what it was like to be a developer over 40:

[Michael](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/our-communitys-first-year-on-medium-dde6d90b9628/undefined) wrote about how campers have shipped over a million dollars worth of code, pro bono:

We also published a lot of success stories, like [Andrew](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/our-communitys-first-year-on-medium-dde6d90b9628/undefined)’s:

[**From Carpenter to Front End Developer in under 5 months**](https://medium.freecodecamp.com/this-is-my-story-about-how-i-went-from-being-a-carpenter-with-zero-experience-in-the-tech-world-to-4252e93cb73)

We even announced results from a survey of new developers here, and released its public dataset:
