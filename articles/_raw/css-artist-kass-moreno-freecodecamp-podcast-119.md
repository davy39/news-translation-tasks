On this week's episode of the podcast, I interview Kass Moreno, a Senior Front End Developer and CSS Artist.

Kass started learning coding at age 28 and has since built a reputation as one of the most skilled artists who work with CSS.

We talk about:

* Her childhood in Mexico and in Texas
* Making the hard decision to drop out of architecture school
* Her dreadful years working as a salesperson
* Learning from freeCodeCamp and doing the 100DaysOfCode challenge
* Getting freelance clients and expanding her skills
* Her rapid career growth as a developer

Can you guess what bass line I'm playing on my bass during the intro? It's a 1982 pop classic.
