## **Angles: Acute, Obtuse, Straight and Right**

There are four types of angles depending on their size in degrees. These are:

* Right angles
* Straight angles
* Acute angles
* Obtuse angles

### **Right angles**

Right angles are angles that have a measure of exactly 90°. For example, the angle at the corner of a square or rectangle is a right angle. An example of a right angle is below:

### **Straight angles**

Right angles are angles that have a measure of exactly 180°. For example, a straight line has a straight angle. An example of a straight angle is below:

### **Acute angles**

Acute angles are angles that have a measure of less than 90°. For example, a capital letter "A" has an acute angle. An example of an acute angle is below:

### **Obtuse angles**

Obtuse angles are angles that have a measure of more than 90° but less than 180°. For example, a clock showing 5 o'clock has an obtuse angle. An example of an obtuse angle is below:

![example of an obtuse angle](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/17547686/31929584-4ec4b216-b8a5-11e7-943d-ea74ce460f1b.png)

## Examples

#### **Example 1**

What is the measure of the largest integer acute angle? Since acute angles are angles with a measure less than 90°, the largest integer acute angle will have a measure of 89°.

#### **Example 2**

What is the measure of the smallest integer obtuse angle? Since obtuse angles are angles with a measure larger than 90°, the smallest integer obtuse angle will have a measure of 91°.

#### **Example 3**

What is the measure of the angle in a capital letter "L", and what type of angle is it?The measure of the angle in a capital letter "L" is 90°, and the angle is a right angle.
