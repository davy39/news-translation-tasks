If you are new to tech, you might have just discovered UI/ UX design and want to pursue that career path. But what is the starting salary for entry level UX/UI designers?

In this article, I will provide definitions for UI/ UX design as well as starting salary information from around the world. 

## What is UX design?

The term User Experience refers to how users interact with a product or service. Whenever you login into a website, or play a game on your phone, your interaction with that application is considered user experience.

If you find a product to be easy to use and understand, then that would be considered a positive user experience. But if the product is confusing and frustrating then that would be considered a negative user experience.

If you want to learn more about UX design, and find resources to start learning, then I would suggest reading my article on [What is UX Design?](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/user-experience-design-what-does-a-ux-designer-do/)

## What is UI design?

The term User Interface refers to the look and feel of a product. For digital products, UI design focuses on all visual aspects including fonts, colors, spacing, responsive design and more. 

Good UI design is considered to be simple, easy to understand and consistent. You don't want users to have to struggle with navigating through the product because it is not intuitive. 

Bad UI design is considered to be inconsistent and difficult to understand. If users are confronted with low quality images, inconsistent fonts or poor contrast in visual content, then the user will want to leave the product as soon as possible.

If you are interested in learning the fundamentals of UI design, then I would suggest reading through [this Per Harald Borgen article](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/learn-ui-design-fundamentals-with-this-free-one-hour-course/).
