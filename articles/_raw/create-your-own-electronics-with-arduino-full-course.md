Arduino is an open-source electronics platform based on easy-to-use hardware and software.

Arduino boards are able to read inputs - light on a sensor, a finger on a button, or a Twitter message - and turn it into an output - activating a motor, turning on an LED, publishing something online. You can tell your board what to do by sending a set of instructions to the microcontroller on the board.

We just released a full course on the freeCodeCamp.org YouTube channel that will teach you how to use Arduino hardware and software.

Ashish Bansal developed this course. He will teach you everything you need to know to start creating your own electronics with Arduino. And you don't even have to have any hardware to follow along.
