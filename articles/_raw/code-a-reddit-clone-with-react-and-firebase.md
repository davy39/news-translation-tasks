Coding a Reddit clone is a great project to help you learn a bunch of different programming skills and technologies.

We just published a course on the freeCodeCamp.org YouTube channel that will teach you how to code a Reddit clone using React, Firebase, Next.js, Chakra UI, and TypeScript.

Shadee Merhi originally created this course. Shadee is a full stack developer and course crator.

The course starts by setting up the project and understanding the fundamental concepts of Next.js, including pages and client-side routing.

Next, we will move on to core package installations, including Chakra-React, Firebase, and Recoil, as well as setting up the ChakraProvider and learning about React 18 (with Chakra). We will also create a Chakra theme and learn about global styling.

We will then delve into React TypeScript and creating a Next.js Layout component. From there, we will begin building the Navbar, including the component folder structure, and learn about Chakra UI styling fundamentals, such as flexbox and responsive design with media queries.

We will also cover important topics such as creating a SearchInput component, authentication buttons and modals, and working with Recoil and Firebase. You will learn how to use hooks such as useCreateUser, useSignInWithGoogle, and useAuthState to manage user data, as well as how to use Firestore transactions and sub-collections.

Additionally, we will cover important features such as creating and joining communities, cloud functions, and server-side rendering with NextJS. We will also learn how to handle deleting posts, customizing community images, and voting on posts.

The course will conclude with a detailed explanation on how to deploy with Vercel and implementing Firebase security rules.

By the end of this course, you will have a strong understanding of how to build a full-featured Reddit clone using the latest technologies, including React, Firebase, Next.js, Chakra UI, and TypeScript. So, It's a great opportunity to learn and improve your coding skills and build a project that you can showcase to potential employers.
