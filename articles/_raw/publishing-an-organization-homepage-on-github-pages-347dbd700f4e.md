I am organizing a local group meetup of [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) called [FreeCodeCamp Vienna](https://www.meetup.com/Free-Code-Camp-Vienna/). Months ago we decided to create a simple homepage to represent the group and it’s progress online. But we never seemed to find the time to do it.

Following the idea “better a quick homepage than no homepage at all” I decided to create one and publish it on GitHub Pages. It allows us to host our static page and also serves as a perfect example for how easy it is to publish something online.

### Name your repository

When publishing to GitHub Pages choosing the right repository name is crucial.

[This page](https://help.github.com/articles/user-organization-and-project-pages/) from GitHub explains it perfectly:

You need to name the repository exactly like the organization with “.github.io” at the end:

### Build your Homepage

After creating the repository build your homepage with HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

**Tip**: I was using [CodePen](https://codepen.io/ddcreationstudios/pen/yogdXX) during development. It is [REPL](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/13603021/what-is-a-repl-in-javascript) (Read–Eval–Print Loop). This allows you to receive instant feedback from the code you are writing.

To speed up the layout process and add cool features I was using [Materialize](http://materializecss.com/getting-started.html). I have used it in the past and always had been happy with the results.

### Put your Code on Github

Next, put your files on GitHub following the instructions.

**Be sure to have the files on your “Master” branch**

And choose the source of your GitHub Pages for the Master branch.

### Set the source for your GitHub Pages

Your settings should look like this:

### See your amazing homepage at the provided link

Follow the provided link or type your organization name with “.github.io” in the URL bar.
