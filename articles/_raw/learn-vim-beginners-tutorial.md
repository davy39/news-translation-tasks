Vim is a highly configurable text editor that you can use for software development or any kind of text editing. 

We just published a full Vim course on the freeCodeCamp.org YouTube channel that will teach you how to use Vim.

Florian Dedov from NeuralNine developed this course.

When someone masters Vim, they can often be more efficient with it than using other text editors. Vim forces you to use only the keyboard and no mouse. This limits the time you waste moving your hand between devices. 

Another great thing about Vim is that it can be installed anywhere and comes preinstalled on many machines. If you need to SSH into a Linux box, Vim is often one of the only text editors available.

In this course you will learn how to use all the most common Vim commands and some common Vim extensions. You will even learn how to exit Vim.
