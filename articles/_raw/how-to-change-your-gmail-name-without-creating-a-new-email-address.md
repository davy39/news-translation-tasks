You might've had your email address for years, so everyone knows it. But let's say you want to change the name associated with that address. Perhaps you're getting married. Or want to create a fabulous stage name for your Hollywood debut.

Whatever the reason, don't worry - you can do it in a few simple steps. Just remember:

* You can't change your username or the actual email address. You can only change the name associated with the account.
* If people have you saved as something else in their contacts, that's the name they'll see. Your "new name" will only show up in emails you send to them.

## Step 1: Open Gmail and go to settings

Open Gmail, and click the gear in the upper right corner:

Select "settings" from the dropdown menu.

## Step 2: Go to the Accounts tab

Then, in settings, select the "Account Info" tab from the menu along the top:

Look for the option to "Send mail as:" and select the "edit info" option.

## Step 3: Edit your info

When you click that "edit info" button a yellow box will pop up. You'll see your name as it's currently displayed, and below it a blank space where you can type in your preferred name.

Type in your new name and select that option. Then save the changes.

Ta-da! Your new name will display when you send emails.

### Things to note

If you can't change your name in Gmail, it could be because

* Your company has disabled that functionality (they probably don't want you changing your name to, for example, Your Royal Highness), or
* You've changed your name too many times recently. Easy there.
