TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript that adds static typing to your code, preventing type errors and other potential bugs. Learning TypeScript can be super helpful for you as a web developer.

We just published a course on the [freeCodeCamp.org Spanish YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/freecodecampespanol) that is designed to teach you TypeScript step by step.

You will start from the basics and gradually dive into more advanced concepts that will prepare you for building two projects step by step with TypeScript, React.js, and Angular.js. By the end of the course, you will be able to create your own web development projects using TypeScript.

If you have Spanish-speaking friends, you are welcome to share the [**Spanish version of this article**](https://www.freecodecamp.org/espanol/news/aprende-typescript-curso-desde-cero/) with them.

This course was created by Sergie Code. Sergie is a software engineer and content creator focused on JavaScript, including React.js, Angular.js, and other frameworks.

Are you ready? Let's see a quick overview of TypeScript and what you will learn during the course.

## **What is TypeScript?**

TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript that adds static types to the programming language. Static typing is very useful for helping you write safe and maintainable code because you can catch errors and potential bugs even before running your code.

TypeScript is widely adopted by the global developer community. It's also a valuable skill that can lead you to many career opportunities.

### **Career Opportunities**

Talking about career opportunities – TypeScript is very popular and it's currently in high demand in the programming industry.

As an example of is relevance and popularity, here we have the results of the most popular technologies of the [Stack Overflow 2023 Developer Survey](https://survey.stackoverflow.co/2023/#most-popular-technologies-language-prof).

When developers where asked the following question:

> Which **programming, scripting, and markup languages** have you done extensive development work in over the past year, and which do you want to work in over the next year? (If you both worked with the language and want to continue to do so, please check both boxes in that row.)

These were the results:

TypeScript was the **fifth** most popular language among all respondents. Specifically, 38.87% of the respondents selected TypeScript as a language that they have worked with in the past year or plan to work in over the next year.

If we break down the results even further, we can see that 21.18% of the respondents who were learning to code when they took the survey had used or planned to use TypeScript during 2024.

The percentage increased to 43.75% among professional developers:

These results show that TypeScript is growing in popularity.

By learning TypeScript, you will have in-demand skills and a solid foundation for your career as a web developer.
