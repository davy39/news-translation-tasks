No-code tools let people across the world build different products and applications without writing code.   
  
Before no-code tools, building simple websites or mobile applications took weeks or months and only experienced software developers could do it. 

But that's not the case anymore. Now, you can spin up blogs, websites, and more using the right no-code tools. And even if you know how to code, these tools can help you become more productive.  
  
There are tons of no-code tools available today. So, choosing the right ones can be tricky. This article aims to highlight some of the best no-code tools for developers to use in 2021.

## Webflow

[Webflow](https://webflow.com/) is a powerful, web-based design tool that gives you the superpower of designing, building, and launching responsive websites without writing a single line of code. Amazing right? I know!

Rather than sketching/designing your projects and then coding them into an actual product, you use a different approach with Webflow.

Websites built with Webflow are powered by Amazon Cloudfront, hosted on Fastly, and don't require external plugins.

**With Webflow, you can:** 

* Create automatic site backups (versioning) and staging URLs. 
* Move from prototype to mockup in minutes. 
* You can design hundreds of pages at once.
* Design, build and launch with no stress at all.
