On this week's episode of the podcast, freeCodeCamp founder Quincy Larson interviews Dr. Chuck. He's a software engineer and Computer Science professor at University of Michigan, which has one of the top-ranked CS programs in the world.

Dr. Charles "Chuck" Severance is also creator of many popular free learning resources like his Python for Everyone and C for Everyone, which millions of students have taken over the past decade.

We talk about:

* What separates a Master Programmer from an average developer, and how to become one
    
* Dr. Chuck's mission to make programming knowledge freely available
    
* The fundamental shortcomings of how Computer Science is currently taught at universities – even elite universities like the one he's a professor at
    
* Dr. Chuck's theories on recent tech layoffs and what he thinks the near future holds
    
* Dr. Chuck's love of racing $2,500 cars that he revives from the junk yard, and flying planes
    

Can you guess what song I'm playing on my bass during the intro? It's a 2015 song from an Australian musician.
