On this week's episode of the podcast, I interview Caleb Curry. He's a software engineer and prolific computer science educator. He recently started mentoring dozens of developers directly and helping them with their skills and careers.

We talk about his experience getting laid off as a dev, and how we prepared for his mid-career job search.

We talk about:

* How Caleb got laid off and went about landing his next developer job
    
* How most people sleep on networking and recruiters, but shouldn't
    
* Why Caleb is so serious about teaching system design concepts
    
* How Caleb pairs his deep focus with broad extracurricular learning through podcasts and white papers
