I hear some of my co-workers talk about getting to inbox zero. So I started thinking of a way to clear out my over over 4000 unread messages. And after days of searching around, I found a way.

I even went on to delete 20,000 email messages from the trash – and saved just over 1 gigabyte of disk space in the process.

There are other ways you can use search operators to query the Gmail app and reveal messages received over the years so you can do what you want with them. You can find those [search operators](https://support.google.com/mail/answer/7190?hl=en) in Google Support.
