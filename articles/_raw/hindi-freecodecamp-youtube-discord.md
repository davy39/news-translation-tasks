Now you can get the same free and ad-free freeCodeCamp learning experience in Hindi.

Today I'm excited to announce that we've launched a Hindi-language YouTube channel.

## The freeCodeCamp Hindi YouTube Channel

So far, we already have two full courses on the channel: Flutter and Python.

And Saturday we will live-stream the first segment of our 5-week-long Data Science with Python course.

You can [subscribe to the freeCodeCamp Hindi channel here](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UClHVZQqHLfbcbwFDwPfdB-A).

This channel is run by prolific YouTuber Pawan Kumar.

Pawan is a Google Developer Expert for technologies like Flutter, Dart, and Firebase. He also runs a tech youtube channel called MTECHVIRAL.

Pawan works as a head of Mobile Engineering at Frontier Wallet. He started his career as an Android dev when he was in college. He likes to experiment with new technologies, and talk about them at events and [on his Twitter](https://twitter.com/imthepk).

Pawan has helped many developers until now around the world in learning new technologies and getting tech jobs.

> "When I was a child, I didn’t have many resources to learn new things. So I decided to help others in learning new awesome things." – Pawan Kumar

And this lead to him creating the official Hindi-language freeCodeCamp YouTube channel.

## The future of freeCodeCamp's Internationalization Efforts

Our community is making steady progress in our internationalization efforts. Look for some other big announcements in the coming months.

Our goal is to eventually have a translated curriculum for every major world language, launch YouTube channels in more major languages.

Again, you can [subscribe to the Hindi YouTube channel here](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UClHVZQqHLfbcbwFDwPfdB-A).

Happy coding.
