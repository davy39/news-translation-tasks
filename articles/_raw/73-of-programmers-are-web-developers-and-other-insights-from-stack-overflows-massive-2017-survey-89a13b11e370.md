Today Stack Overflow released the results of their 2017 survey of more than 64,000 developers.

[Just like in 2016](https://medium.freecodecamp.com/2-out-of-3-developers-are-self-taught-and-other-insights-from-stack-overflow-s-2016-survey-of-50-8cf0ee5d4c21#.lkodanohw), I’ve combed through these results and summarized them for you.

Here’s a lightning-fast snapshot of what the software development profession looks like in 2017.

#### A vast majority of developers consider themselves “web developers.”

#### Most web developers consider themselves “full stack developers.”

#### JavaScript is by far the most popular tool programmers use today.

#### Developers work in a wide variety of industries — most of them outside of what we traditionally call “tech.”

![Image](https://cdn-media-1.freecodecamp.org/images/3S0Kb8YdVpFql42MAWHxwjSkKS8chUYPJaTu)

#### Most of them work at companies with fewer than 500 employees.

![Image](https://cdn-media-1.freecodecamp.org/images/A90bpxL40CU4rwEQjW4Bm0t2LHo1jY3KJIK7)

#### But less than 1 in 5 of them work at a startup.

#### Most of them work as full-time employees.

#### Two-thirds of them got their current job through someone they already knew, or were approached by a recruiter.

#### Regardless of their specialization, developers make good money.

#### And if they happen to be in America, they make even more money.

#### This said, most of them feel underpaid for the caliber of work they do.

#### Two out of three developers work from home at least a few days a month.

#### And they prefer to listen to music while they work.

![Image](https://cdn-media-1.freecodecamp.org/images/nTPdXKaS8454LCHBqM2XqchpkM0sR95ci-Ds)

#### 30% of all developers have been coding for less than 5 years.

![Image](https://cdn-media-1.freecodecamp.org/images/WNryTDYkNU0VIWDHRX38l-rYI67xxA9qwenF)

#### Most developers went to college, but nearly a quarter of working developers never finished a 4-year degree.

![Image](https://cdn-media-1.freecodecamp.org/images/4kIE4jUZAQefkBpFPMWw3Z8rvzWU5BJYSPy3)

#### 80% of college-educated developers studied some kind of technology-related major.

![Image](https://cdn-media-1.freecodecamp.org/images/YKLU3Peh5k8YmdyAwIVWM8dWmbWZ2eq6WhDL)

#### Despite this, less than half of developers consider their formal education to be “important” or “very important” to their jobs.

![Image](https://cdn-media-1.freecodecamp.org/images/6GwMITEgHoGmOoK95M0vwlQozk8tnZyi8oFs)

#### Even though software development is dominated by men, it’s becoming more diverse. Just [one year ago](https://medium.freecodecamp.com/2-out-of-3-developers-are-self-taught-and-other-insights-from-stack-overflow-s-2016-survey-of-50-8cf0ee5d4c21#.lkodanohw), 93% of respondents were male. This time, only 89% were.

#### 1 in 100 developers are blind, and 1 in 200 developers are deaf.
