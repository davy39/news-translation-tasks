We spend a considerable portion of our time using a web browser. Sometimes we may need to get a screenshot of a full page in our browser.

I recently learned that Google Chrome has the option to do that, without using any additional extensions. In this article, we will see how to do that.

### Open DevTools Inside Chrome

First, we need to open [DevTools](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/) inside Chrome. We can open it in different ways:

1. *Main Menu* (three vertical dots) in the top-right corner &gt; *More tools* &gt; *Developer tools.*
    
2. We can also open it using the following keyboard shortcuts: `Control+Shift+I` in Windows and Linux, or `Command+Option+I` in Mac.
    
3. Another way to open it, is by right-clicking anywhere in the page and select *Inspect*.
    

### Open the Command Menu

Now we need to open the command menu. We can do that by pressing `Control+Shift+P` in Windows and Linux, or `Command+Shift+P` in Mac.

### Capture Screenshot

Then, we need to write and select *Capture full size screenshot*. After we have done that, we should get a PNG file as a screenshot for the full page.

That’s it for this quick tip. It’s really simple, but I think it can be very useful.
