I recently left [Space Ape Games](http://spaceapegames.com/) after a won­der­ful year. I learnt a lot, and worked on some [chal­leng­ing tech­ni­cal prob­lems](https://tech.spaceapegames.com/2017/10/24/tackling-scalability-challenges-in-realtime-multiplayer-games-with-akka-and-aws/).

Here are seven lessons that I learned from one of the most well-run companies I have encountered in my 13 year career.

### Define what culture you want, and organize yourself to optimize towards achieving that culture

Lots of com­pa­nies talk about how great their cul­ture is, but few talk about _what their cul­ture actually is_. Worse yet, I sus­pect most end up with a cul­ture they don’t want, because the cul­ture grew organ­i­cal­ly and with­out guid­ance.

To this day, the [Net­flix cul­ture deck](https://www.slideshare.net/reed2001/culture-2009/) from 2009 is still the one of the best things you can read about cul­ture.

> Real com­pa­ny val­ues are the behav­iors and skills that we par­tic­u­lar­ly val­ue in fel­low employ­ees.

Be clear about the culture you want to build from the start. These are the characteristics and skills that we value in each other at Space Ape:

**Pas­sion­ate**: you have a pas­sion for games, and you want to build games that are fun and engag­ing.

**Cre­ative**: you are not afraid to stray off the beat­en path and try some­thing new. You accept the risks that come with cre­ativ­i­ty. You won’t let fail­ures stop you from suc­ceed­ing.

**Judge­ment**: you make smart bets. You bal­ance the risks of cre­ativ­i­ty with method­i­cal analy­sis of the poten­tial rewards to make smart bets.

**Depend­able**: you are depend­able and trust­wor­thy. We believe in small, autonomous teams. For this to work, we need to be able to depend on every indi­vid­ual in the team.

**Focus**: when required, you can put aside per­son­al projects and focus on delivering the best game pos­si­ble.

**Mas­tery**: you are a mas­ter of your craft. You want to become the best ver­sion of your­self and are always look­ing for ways to improve.

**Col­lab­o­ra­tive**: you work well with oth­ers. You are will­ing to make sac­ri­fices and com­pro­mis­es for the greater good of the com­pa­ny. Game mak­ing is an inher­ent­ly cre­ative and col­lab­o­ra­tive process. We need peo­ple that can thrive in a col­lab­o­ra­tive envi­ron­ment.

**Inclu­sive**: you wel­come oth­ers for who they are. You treat oth­ers equal­ly and fair­ly, the same way that you expect to be treat­ed.

**Reit­er­ate** **this vision regularly**. We find that if it is not reiterated at least once every couple of months, then it starts to slip through the collective consciousness.

Make sure new employ­ees are imbued with your vision. And remind employees of their duty to main­tain your culture.

### Culture lives and dies by the people you hire and fire

This shared under­stand­ing of cul­ture needs to filter through to every hir­ing deci­sion.

“C_ul­ture fit_” is often used to enforce exist­ing bias­es, especially when said culture is nev­er defined up front to begin with. Fortunately, this has nev­er been the case in any of the hir­ing com­mit­tees I have sat on. When­ev­er “cul­ture fit” is raised as a con­cern, you must give clear exam­ples from your inter­ac­tion with the inter­vie­wee.

At the same time, you shouldn’t hire some­one who might be detri­men­tal to your cul­ture — not even when you are des­per­ate for anoth­er pair of hands on deck!

The cost of a bad hire to your cul­ture is too great.

The founders also act as the van­guards for your cul­ture. They watch from afar, but they’re nev­er afraid to step in when they see the dan­ger signs. If a long time employ­ee starts to show signs of self-enti­tle­ment, then expect a gen­tle reminder about the company’s com­mit­ment to inclu­sion and fairness.

Even when you have built a great culture, you can’t afford to take it for granted. **It’s the duty of everyone involved to keep that culture strong**.

### People are your most important product

This is true for most com­pa­nies, which is why it should be a no-brain­er to invest in the peo­ple and help them grow.

Offer train­ing bud­gets to every­one, and pro­vide man­agers with man­age­ment coach­es. The results will be well worth it.

### Founders need to communicate the vision of the company openly, clearly, and frequently

Avoid impres­sive-sound­ing but vague mis­sion state­ments. Vague goals that do not define clear, action­able tar­gets are hard to fol­low and apply. Collaboration suf­fers when peo­ple do not have a **shared under­stand­ing** of the com­pa­ny vision.

Our founders reit­er­ate the com­pa­ny mis­sion at every quar­ter­ly com­pa­ny meet­ing. The **rep­e­ti­tion** has been impor­tant in rein­forc­ing the _shared_ _under­stand­ing_ of the goal. I recent­ly also saw Ryan Cald­beck, the CEO of _Cir­cle­Up,_ say the same thing on Twit­ter.

Our mis­sion state­ment is _“to build a top gross­ing mobile game by own­ing a genre.”_ Sim­ple, unglam­orous, but easy to under­stand.

### Be honest about conflict of interest

Man­agers usu­al­ly have the best inten­tions when they set out per­son­al objectives for their charges. Every­one gets a set of objec­tives that align with the company’s goal. Where is the con­flict of inter­est?

_What you might think when you set out personal objectives._

Things seldom work out as you expect, though. What usually hap­pens is that some projects will go more smooth­ly than oth­ers. At the same time, some projects deliv­er more val­ue to the com­pa­ny than oth­ers.

Nod if this sce­nario sounds famil­iar.

You’re work­ing on project X, and your end of year pay raise, bonus, and promotion hopes are all rid­ing on the suc­cess of project X.

A col­league is work­ing on project Y, and he needs you to work on some­thing to unblock his project. Project Y is more valu­able to the com­pa­ny, but help­ing this col­league means los­ing progress on project X.

What do you do?

Do you do the right thing by the com­pa­ny and help this col­league? In the process you might lose the pay raise, bonus, and pro­mo­tion that you have worked so hard for.

Or do you put his request in the back­log and focus on project X?

Hel­lo, _con­flict of inter­est_.

_What actually happens when employees need to collaborate with one another, and often have to sacrifice their self-interest for the greater good of the company._

If you think this only hap­pens in poor­ly-run com­pa­nies, then you’re wrong. Even Google is not immune to this con­flict of inter­est, as is evi­dent in Michael Lynch’s [arti­cle](https://mtlynch.io/why-i-quit-google/) on why he quit Google.

**Team­work requires _will­ing_ sac­ri­fice.**

In foot­ball, a “team play­er” car­ries the con­no­ta­tion of being will­ing to sac­ri­fice themselves for the team. Be it risk­ing injury in a 50–50 chal­lenge, or pass­ing to a team­mate who’s more like­ly to score.

How do you trans­late this to the work place? How do you encour­age peo­ple to make will­ing sac­ri­fices for the good of the com­pa­ny?

You have to start by being hon­est about this con­flict of inter­est.

Your employ­ees are not saints, they are flesh and blood with real world problems. What if they need the pay raise to start a fam­i­ly? And what’s wrong with want­i­ng career pro­gres­sion?

Employ­ees have every right to act in their best inter­est. It is your job as employ­er to **cre­ate an envi­ron­ment where employ­ees are not penalized for mak­ing self-sac­ri­fice**.

You can do this in sev­er­al ways.

The biggest, most effective way is to **sep­a­rate** **per­son­al objec­tives and 360 reviews from performance and salary reviews**.

Per­son­al objec­tives are for your per­son­al devel­op­ment only. Your man­ag­er can help you decide what areas to improve on, but the final deci­sion is yours. You’re encour­aged, but _not required_, to set per­son­al objec­tives.

360 reviews are also for you and you alone. You choose from whom you want feedback, and how to pro­ceed with the feed­back you receive.

The feed­back is anonymous, and only the man­ag­er of the review­er knows who delivered that feedback. This is main­ly to mit­i­gate any unnec­es­sary ten­sion from ill-considered feed­back.

Your man­ag­er and the founders are also there to help you process the feedback if you need their help.

Per­for­mance and salary reviews are based on what you **actu­al­ly con­tributed**, not some arbi­trary tar­gets that were set months ago.

For us, this unusu­al way of work­ing start­ed with a frank dis­cus­sion about this conflict of inter­est. It has been iter­at­ed upon over time and will con­tin­ue to evolve. It’s been such a fresh breath of air for me to work for a com­pa­ny that not only rec­og­nizes the prob­lem but active­ly seeks to tack­le it.

### Marry creativity with ownership

Cul­ti­vate cre­ativ­i­ty from the whole com­pa­ny using game jams and hackathons. But remember that **cre­ativ­i­ty needs to be guid­ed, and hypotheses need to be test­ed.**

We use a creative funnel to guide ideas from hypothesis to production.

The game jams gen­er­ate ideas to feed the top of the funnel. Every­one can come up with ideas for new games. You have the **own­er­ship** and **responsibility** to pol­ish your idea and pitch it to the rest of the com­pa­ny.

![Image](https://cdn-media-1.freecodecamp.org/images/0*G_52ShW4NtA41tWg.png)

Teams form organ­i­cal­ly around ideas that they’re excit­ed about and believe can be top-gross­ing. **This is NOT a top-down deci­sion**.

The founders are there to offer guid­ance and help with per­son­nel move­ment. Whilst your idea might be great, the founders can guide you on shap­ing the idea to fit your mis­sion.

_Is it eco­nom­i­cal­ly fea­si­ble to build?_

_What is the mar­ket com­pe­ti­tion like? Is the genre sat­u­rat­ed with high qual­i­ty offer­ings already? Does this genre have top gross­ing poten­tial?_

_Do we have the tech­ni­cal exper­tise to build it? If not, how dif­fi­cult is it to hire someone with that exper­tise?_

The teams that form around an idea focus on pro­to­typ­ing and iter­at­ing on the idea. The idea becomes a playable game, and the rest of the com­pa­ny then plays and pro­vides feed­back.

The team owns the idea, and is trust­ed with mak­ing the deci­sions to keep going or kill it if they no longer believe in it. Again, **this is NOT a top-down deci­sion —** the deci­sion is made within the team.

Which brings us to the next point.

### Recognize that creativity requires mistakes

**Cre­ativ­i­ty needs fail­ures to suc­ceed**.

Being cre­ative and exper­i­ment­ing with new ideas means tak­ing on risks. If you don’t risk, you will not win big — at least not with­out the mar­ket­ing bud­get and brand that goes with estab­lished franchises.

To let teams take on risk, and to trust them to make the right deci­sion on the company’s behalf and kill a pro­to­type, is hard.

For this to hap­pen, you need **an envi­ron­ment where employ­ees are not penalized for mak­ing sacrifices**.

We do this by cre­at­ing a **safe­ty net for jobs**.

Your job is not tied to the pro­to­type. If a team decides to kill its idea, then the team mem­bers move into oth­er game teams, or they’ll stay togeth­er and pro­to­type anoth­er game idea.

To prove this approach works beyond our scale, con­sid­er _Super­cell_ and _Clash Royale_. The team behind _Clash Royale_ was work­ing on anoth­er idea before they came up with that one. The idea test­ed well in beta, it had good reten­tion and mon­e­ti­za­tion stats. But it was not great, cer­tain­ly not on par with _Clash of Clans_.

The team made the deci­sion to kill the idea because they believed they could do bet­ter. So they took the learn­ings from the previous game, iter­at­ed on the ideas fur­ther, and they cre­at­ed _Clash Royale_.

Rec­og­nize that peo­ple and their tal­ents are your great­est assets. **Hire and keep great peo­ple** rather than hiring for and keeping certain roles.

### Conclusions

So there you have it. Seven things that I learned from my time at _Space Ape Games_.

What stood out most for me is that a company needs to have a clear identity — it needs to know who it wants to be, and it needs to orga­nize itself to become that com­pa­ny.

And while I love the ethos on small autonomous teams, and the flat hierarchy structure, it also has a downside: at this stage of my career, I am accus­tomed to hav­ing a wide range of respon­si­bil­i­ties, and I crave it.

As time went by, I felt that itch for more respon­si­bil­i­ty creep­ing back. When my old friend _Bruno Tavares_ pitched me the idea of join­ing _DAZN_ to work on all the great things they’re doing, it was hard to say no.

With a heavy heart, this is my farewell let­ter to _Space Ape Games_ and the great peo­ple with­in. You guys are awesome! And I hope the lessons I’ve learned there help others as well.
