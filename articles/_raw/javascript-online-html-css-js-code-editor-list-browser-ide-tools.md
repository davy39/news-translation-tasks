There are many benefits to coding in an online IDE or code editor. With these tools you don't need to set anything up locally, you can easily share your work, and they are often free to use.

In this article, you'll learn what a code editor and an IDE are. Then I will also share 7 online editors and IDE's that work best with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 

## What is a Code Editor?

A code editor is a tool that is designed to write and edit code. Popular offline code editors include Visual Studio Code, Atom, Brackets, and Sublime Text. 

Code editors make it possible for web developers to write programs that will run on the web. Code editors are helpful especially because they highlight syntax errors and provide automatic code indentation, code completion, and other useful features. 

## What is an IDE?

IDE stands for integrated development environment. You can use this tool as a compiler, editor, and debugger – so it's much more involved than a basic code editor.

A compiler is a program that takes the code you write and translates it into something machines can read. A debugger is a tool that allows you to step through your code line by line and identify issues (bugs) so you can fix them. 

## Why Choose an Online Editor Over a Local Editor?

When is it a good time to choose an online editor over your local environment like Visual Studio Code?

There may be times where you just want to share a quick working example on Stack Overflow and using a free online editor is a quicker solution than building it locally. 

Or maybe you want to share a small working example of a new feature for documentation? It would be easier to place your code into an online editor and share the URL than go through the trouble of deploying the project from your local device. 

Now that you know what code editors and IDEs are, let's discuss some of the most popular ones out there at the moment.

## CodeSandbox
