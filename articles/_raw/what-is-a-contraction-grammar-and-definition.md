Take  a look at the following sentences:

I’m learning how to  code.

I'll get a software developer job. 

Learning how to code doesn’t have to cost you money.

The words **I’m**, **I’ll** and **doesn’t** are called contractions.

In this article, you'll learn all about contractions – what they are, when and where you'll most likely come across them, when and when not to use them. Finally you'll see some of the most common contractions used in the English language.

Let's get started!

## What are contractions?

Contractions, also known as 'short forms', are shortened words.

Specifically, a contraction is when two words are shortened in form and are put together to form one new word.

For example, `you` and `are` can be combined to create a shorter word, `you’re`.

When two words are combined, certain letters will disappear. You can lose just one letter or more, depending on the contraction.

When you combine those two words and the letter(s) disappear, an apostrophe (`’`) will take their place. 

The missing, original letters get replaced by the apostrophe to show the place where the missing letters should be. Those letters will not appear in the contraction (as they've been replaced by the apostrophe).

For example, take the word `isn't`. This contraction combines the words `is` and `not`. When those two get paired together, the letter `o` disappears. An apostrophe now takes its place to show where the missing letter was.

Another example is when `you` and `will` get combined to form `you'll`. Now two letters disappear,`w` and `i`, and the apostrophe fills that space of two missing letters.

## When do you use contractions?

We use contractions every day in both speech and writing.

You'll hear them from your friends, family, and on TV. You'll see them in novels, non-fiction books, newspapers, instruction manuals, blog posts, learning material, and much more. There are a couple in this very paragraph, and I use them throughout this article.

They are informal and casual, since they give your writing a more friendly, light, accessible, and approachable tone. 

Contractions can make the reader feel like you are talking directly to them and having a conversation. It helps make your writing appear uncomplicated for everyone to understand and make sense of.

Because contractions are shorter, it also means that they take up less space. Because of that, you'll often see them in advertisements where space is valuable.

In a nutshell, you can comfortably use contractions in more informal writing and on relaxed occasions.


### When to avoid using contractions

It's best to avoid using contractions when you want to maintain a more serious and formal tone in your writing.

For example, skip using them in academic research papers, important business presentations, or in any situation where informal writing or speech would not make much sense.

## Common contractions

Below are some of the most widely used and common contractions you'll encounter when speaking and writing in English.

### Common Contractions ending in `-ll`

Contractions ending in `-ll` include the word `will`. The `w` and `i` letters get dropped.

| Contracted      | Uncontracted |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| I’ll   | I + will       |
| She’ll      | She + will       |
| It’ll   | It + will       |
| We’ll      |    We + will    |
| You’ll   | You + will       |
| They’ll   | They + will        |
| Who’ll   | Who + will       |
| That’ll   | That + will       |
| There’ll   | There + will       |
| What’ll   | What + will       |
| When’ll   | When + will       |
| Where’ll   | Where + will       |
| How’ll   | How + will       |

### Common Contractions ending in `-re`

Contractions ending in `-re` include the word `are`. The letter `a` gets dropped.

| Contracted      | Uncontracted |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| We’re   | We + are      |
| You’re   |    You + are   |
| They’re      | You + are       |
| Who’re      | Who + are       |
| What’re      | What + are       |
| When’re      | When + are       |
| Where’re      | Where + are       |
| Why’re      | Why + are       |
| How’re      | How + are       |


### Common Contractions ending in `-s`

Contractions ending in `-s` include either the word `is` or `has`.

For example:

- `He is going = He’s going`
- `It has gone = It’s gone`.

The letter `i` or the letters `h` and `a`, respectively, get dropped.

| Contracted      | Uncontracted |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| He’s   | He + is / He + has     |
| She’s   |  She + is / She + has  |
| It’s      | It + is / It + has       |
| Who’s   |  Who + is / Who + has  |
| There’s   |  There + is / There + has  |
| Thats’s   |  That + is / That + has  |
| What’s   |  What + is  |
| When’s   |  When + is  |
| Where’s   |  Where + is |
| Why’s   |  Why + is |
| How’s   |  How + is |

What about `let's` ? That is a bit different. `let's` comes from `let + us`.

### Common Contractions ending in `-ve`

Contractions ending in `-ve` include the word `have`. The letters `h` and `a` get dropped.

| Contracted      | Uncontracted |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| I’ve  |  I + have  |
| You’ve    | You + have      |
| We’ve  |  We + have |
| They’ve  |  They + have  |
| Could’ve  | Could + have    |
| Would’ve   |  Would + have |
| Should’ve  |  Should + have  |
| Must’ve  |  Must + have  |
| Might’ve  |  Might + have  |
| Who’ve  |  Who + have  |
| What’ve  |  What + have  |
| When’ve  |  When + have  |
| Where’ve  |  Where + have  |
| Why’ve  |  Why + have  |
| How’ve  |  How + have  |

### Common Contractions ending in `-d`

Contractions ending in `-d` include either the word `had` or `would`.

Some examples with the word `had`:

- `I'd better go now = I had better go now`
- `I wish I'd never left = I wish I had never left`.

Some examples with the word `would`:

- `I'd rather not go there = I would rather not go there`
- `I'd like something to drink please = I would like something to drink please`.


| Contracted      | Uncontracted |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| I’d    | I + had / I + would     |
| She’d  | She + had / She + would |
| We’d  | We + had / We + would  |
| They’d |  They + had / They + would |
| Who’d  |  Who + had / Who + would |
| That’d  |  That + had / That + would |
| What’d  |  What + had / What + would |
|There’d |  There + had / There + would |
| When’d  |  When + had / When + would |
| Where’d  |  Where + had / Where + would |
| Why’d  |  Why + had / Why + would |
| How’d  |  How + had / How + would |

### Common Contractions ending in `-m`

Contractions ending in `-m`,include the word `am`. 

The letter `a` gets dropped.

| Contracted      | Uncontracted |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| I’m  | I + am  |

### Negative contractions

Negative contractions are those that end in `-nt`.

You achieve this by adding the word `not` to a verb, making it negative.

In this case,the letter `o` gets dropped.

| Contracted      | Uncontracted |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Can’t  | Can + not  |
| Hadn’t  |Had + not |
| Hasn’t  | Has + not  |
| Haven’t  | Have + not |
| Didn’t  | Did + not |
| Doesn’t  | Does + not |
| Don’t  | Do + not |
| Daren’t  | Dare + not |
| Couldn’t  | Could + not |
| Wouldn’t  | Would + not |
| Shouldn’t  | Should + not |
| Mustn’t  | Must + not |
| Mightn't  | Might + not |
| Oughtn’t | Ought + not |
| Needn’t  |Need + not |
| Wasn't  |Was+ not |
| Isn’t |Is+ not |
| Aren’t  |Are + not |
| Weren’t  |Were + not |
| Shan’t  | Shall + not |

A word that is a little different and an exception to what has been shown so far is `won’t` – it comes from `will + not = won’t`. 

`will` does not turn into `willn’t`. In fact the word "will" does not appear in the contraction at all. Just think of it as an irregular contraction (like how we have irregular verbs).


## Common mistakes with contractions

A couple of contractions commonly cause confusion and people often use them in the wrong way - you'll even see native English speakers make these mistakes.

These contractions sound exactly the same with other words, so these mistakes commonly occur in writing.

### You’re and Your

`You’re` is a contraction, a combination of the words `you` and `are`.

For example, `You’re learning how to code` or `You’re doing great!`.

`Your` is a possesive pronoun, it is used to indicate that something is owned by/belongs to someone.

For example, `Your cat is so cuddly!` or `Your cooking always tastes so good`.

`Your doing great` makes no sense since it doesn't indicate that something belongs to someone. `You’re doing great` does, since it indicates action and verbs are used for that.

If you get confused and don't know which to use, read it out to yourself as `you are` and see if it sounds right.

`Your are cat is so cuddly!` doesn't make sense or sound right, for example.

### It’s and Its

`It’s` is a contraction – a combinations of `it` and `is` or `has`.

For example, `It’s raining outside` or `It’s been great for me so far, I’m really enjoying it here`.

`Its` is a possesive pronoun. `Its` shows possession.

For example, `Don’t judge a book by its cover` or `The cat is in its sleeping basket`.

Similarly to the example from the previous section, if you're confused use the verbs `is` or `has` in your sentence and check to see if it makes sense to add the apostrophe/make it a contraction: `Don’t judge a book by it is cover` doesn't make sense, so you use the possessive "its" with no apostrophe.

`It is raining outside` makes sense, so you now know that you can use an apostrophe.


### They’re, Their, and There

All three of these words sound the same.

`They’re` is a contraction. `They` and `are` were combined.

For example,`They’re going away for the holiday season` or `They’re buying a house together`.

Does the sentence sound right when you use `they are`? Then use `they’re`.

`Their` shows possesion. 

For example,`Their dog bit me last night` or `I don’t like their attitude`.

Finally, `There` indicates a place, a location.

For example,`I wish I was there instead` or `I’m never going there again`.
