Remember the game Snake that came pre-installed on every Nokia phone back in the 1990s? You steered a snake around your screen, trying to feed it without crashing it into a wall or into its own growing body.

Well this game development tutorial will show you how to build that classic Snake game and get it playable in your browser.

You won’t use any libraries, ether. Just standard JavaScript. And you’ll get to learn some functional programming, too!

Christopher Okhravi is a Swedish PhD student who has created lots of great programming tutorials on YouTube. He is excellent at explaining concepts - a “boss-level lecturer” as one commenter called him.

And Christopher has put [all the source code for the tutorial on GitHub](https://github.com/chrokh/snake) for your reference.

You can watch his talk on [the freeCodeCamp.org YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRlvGoWz6Ig) (93 minute watch).‌
