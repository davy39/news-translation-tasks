Looking to get hands-on with AI? We just posted a comprehensive course on the [freeCodeCamp.org](http://freeCodeCamp.org) YouTube channel designed to help you build powerful AI agent applications. Led by Cerebras growth engineer Sarah Chieng alongside industry experts from Exa, LangChain, and LiveKit, this 3-part series is has everything you need to get started with real-world AI use cases.

Cerebras provided a grant to make this course possible. Cerebras creates chips that are built on a custom wafer-sized AI processor and are 20X faster than GPUs. You can get a free Cerebras API key at [https://cloud.cerebras.ai?referral\_code=freecodecamp](https://cloud.cerebras.ai?referral_code=freecodecamp).

## What You'll Build

Throughout the series, we’ll walk you through how to create

* Interactive Voice Agents - Build conversational AI that can speak and listen in real-time
    
* Intelligent Research Assistants - Create AI systems that can search, analyze, and synthesize information from across the web
    
* Multi-Agent Workflows - Develop sophisticated systems where multiple AI agents collaborate to solve complex tasks
    

Each workshop includes sample code, practical exercises, and open-source example repositories to help you follow along and build your own projects. You'll learn how to use popular AI tools and frameworks like LiveKit for real-time communication, Exa for intelligent web search, and LangChain for building multi-agent AI applications.

### Workshop 1: Building Voice Agents with LiveKit and Cerebras

Learn how to build a sophisticated real-time voice sales agent that can have natural conversations with potential customers. You'll create both single-agent and multi-agent systems where specialized AI assistants handle sales, technical support, and pricing inquiries.

What you'll learn:

* Implement intelligent web search strategies using Exa's neural search
    
* Design information synthesis and summarization systems
    
* Create citation tracking and source verification workflows
    
* Build interactive research interfaces with real-time results
    

*Get started:* [Build Your Own Perplexity with Exa](https://inference-docs.cerebras.ai/cookbook/agents/build-your-own-perplexity#build-your-own-perplexity-with-exa)

### Workshop 3: Developing Multi-Agent Workflows

Build an AI-powered user research system that automatically generates user personas, conducts interviews, and synthesizes insights using LangGraph's multi-agent workflow. You'll create a complete research automation system that can deliver comprehensive user insights in under 60 seconds.
