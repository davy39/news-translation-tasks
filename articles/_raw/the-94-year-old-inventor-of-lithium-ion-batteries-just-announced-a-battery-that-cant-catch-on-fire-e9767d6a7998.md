Here are three links worth your time:

1. University of Texas professor John Goodenough (an ironic name for an inventor) lead a team to develop the next generation of batteries that charge 3 times faster and won’t catch on fire no matter how badly you abuse them ([3 minute read](http://bit.ly/2m3Fijh))
2. How much should you charge for your Software-as-a-Service tool? I analyzed prices from 1,530 products to find out ([4 minute read](http://bit.ly/2mBhBlC))
