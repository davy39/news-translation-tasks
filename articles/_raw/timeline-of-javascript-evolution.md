From the early days of the wild wild web, JavaScript has been there. Its evolved from a simple two week hack into a vibrant ecosystem that is continuously evolving to the modern web.

In this talk, Matt Hippely walks the timeline of JavaScripts evolution from where it began into what it has become today. He uses demo apps to show how things used to be built in JavaScript and how they are built today. He also demonstrates how to write JavaScript that is up to date with modern practices.
