If you are a software developer, you likely use Git all the time. But many developers don't use advanced git commands that can speed up their worflow.

We just published a course on the freeCodeCamp.org YouTube channel that will teach you how to use advanced git commands.

Tobias Günther created this course. He has many years of experience using git and even co-founded Tower, a company that creates a GUI client for git.

In this course you will learn how to use Git tools such as:

* Interactive Rebase
* Cherry-Picking
* Reflog
* Submodules
* Search & Find
