Large Language Models like ChatGPT can be used to increase your productivity on a ton of different types of tasks. To use LLMs effectively, it is important to understand prompt engineering strategies. 

We just published a crash course on the freeCodeCamp.org YouTube channel that will teach you how to increase the effectiveness of LLMs and super charge your productivity.

Ania Kubów developed this course. She is one of the most popular instructors on our channel and has created many well-loved courses about ChatGPT.

While many tech courses heavily focus on hands-on coding, this course takes a different route. It delves deep into the understanding of prompt engineering, ensuring that learners grasp the core concepts and strategies.

Here are the topics you will learn about in this course:

* What is Prompt Engineering?
* Introduction to AI
* Why is Machine learning useful?
* Linguistics
* Language Models
* Prompt Engineering Mindset
* Using GPT-4
* Best practices
* Zero shot and few shot prompts
* AI hallucinations
* Vectors/text embeddings

So if you're looking to diversify your skills, understand the mechanics behind your favorite AI tools, or step into a booming domain, this course is the perfect starting point.
