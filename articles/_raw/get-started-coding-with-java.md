Java is one of the most popular programming languages. It can run on all the major operating systems and can be used to write native Android apps.

We posted a beginner's Java course on the freeCodeCamp.org YouTube channel. 

This course was developed by Matt Speake. Matt has been programming for over 20 years. He has many popular courses on Udemy and other platforms.

In this course, Matt will teach you the following fundamentals of Java:

* an **overview of the Java platform** - why it's so popular and who uses it.
* an **understanding of the Java platform components** - you'll discover platform independence and learn the meaning of JVM, JDK and JRE.
* you'll **install the Java Development Kit** and **get set up to use it** - this is what all Java programs are built on.
* you'll **install an IDE (Eclipse)** and learn how to use it to program in Java.
* you'll get **acquainted with Java programming syntax** in easy bitesize pieces that are basic but practical.
* you'll **explore writing some very beginner-friendly Java code in the IDE**.

After the course, you'll have the confidence to move on and take your Java knowledge further.
