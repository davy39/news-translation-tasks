Are you looking to improve your Flutter skills and build a fully-functional Twitter clone?

We just published a course on the freeCodeCamp.org YouTube channel that will teach you how to use Flutter, Appwrite, and Riverpod to create a Twitter clone.

Rivaan Ranawat created this course. He is an expereinced course creator and developer.

Throughout the course, you'll learn how to use Flutter 3.7 to build a Twitter clone with various features such as signing up and signing in with email and password, tweeting text, images, and links, identifying and storing hashtags, displaying tweets, liking tweets, retweeting, commenting/replying, following users, searching for users, displaying followers, following, and recent tweets, editing user profiles, and more.

One of the highlights of the course is the implementation of a notifications tab that will show notifications when someone replies to you, follows you, likes your tweet, or retweets. You'll also learn how to implement a premium feature called "Twitter Blue."

The course assumes that you already have basic knowledge of Flutter and Dart, and it covers various topics, including Appwrite Authentication, Database, Storage, Realtime, Queries, Indexes, and Riverpod.

The course is divided into several chapters, each of which covers a specific topic related to building a Twitter clone. The first chapter covers the installation of Appwrite and Docker, while the second chapter covers important Appwrite commands. The third and fourth chapters cover the setup of Appwrite for Android and iOS, respectively. The rest of the chapters cover various features of the Twitter clone, such as the login and signup UI, providing the class/dependency injection, saving user data to Appwrite database, displaying tweets, liking tweets, retweeting, commenting/replying, searching for users, and more.

By the end of the course, you'll have all the skills you need to build a fully-functional Twitter clone that you can customize and improve upon. So, if you're ready to take your Flutter skills to the next level and build a Twitter clone, then this course is for you!

The course is suitable for both beginners and advanced developers and includes links to the source code and Discord server for community support.
