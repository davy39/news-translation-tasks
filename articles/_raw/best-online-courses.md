Every year [Class Central](https://www.classcentral.com/) releases a list of the [Best Free Online Courses Of All Time](https://www.classcentral.com/collection/top-free-online-courses), based on tens of thousands of user reviews.

This year, thanks to a growing number of reviews, I've expanded the list from 200 to 250 courses.

For close to ten years, well-known and well-respected universities like Stanford and MIT have been publishing free versions of their courses online. 

At first, these “courses” consisted primarily of recorded audio from lecture halls and electronic documents with syllabuses and assignments.

Then, between 2011 and 2013, new platforms such as Coursera and edX began offering more interactive university courses, still totally online and free for anyone to use. 

These university courses attracted so many learners – more than 1000,000 in some cases – that they picked up the name MOOCs, short for [massive open online courses](https://www.classcentral.com/help/moocs). 

Each year, universities release more MOOCs are released, contributing to an ever-growing collection of university content that anyone can use for learning. While not all [courses have remained free](https://www.classcentral.com/help/moocs-cost), all the courses on this list feature content that is free to access (though you will probably have to pay a fee if you wish to earn a certificate).

Fun fact: did you know there are now more than [15,000 MOOCs](https://www.classcentral.com/subjects), from around [1,000 universities](https://www.classcentral.com/universities) worldwide? With numbers like that, it’s easy to become overwhelmed by the choices. That’s where this list comes in.

Whether you’re online learning curious, or a dedicated online learner with a dozen courses under your belt, there’s probably something in these 250 courses that you could learn. You can bookmark this list and share it with your friends.

# Methodology and Summary Statistics

Now, for those keeping score:

This list is based on more than **170,**000 user reviews****. To generate the list, we sorted the courses in our database by the Bayesian average of their ratings, then removed courses with fewer reviews and courses that have been discontinued.

* The Best of All Time rankings features courses from **100+ **universities in** 26 **countries****.
* Combined, these courses have accumulated over 48 million enrollments.
* The country with the most courses is the United States with 102 courses, followed by the UK with 27 courses.

Max is a powerful platform that accommodates and connects a wide variety of tools for sound, graphics, music and interactivity using a flexible patching and programming environment. Max allows most computer users to write a simple, meaningful program within a few minutes, even with limited programming knowledge. But to do something more substantial it’s necessary to approach Max as an actual programming language, by taking advantage of its various mechanisms for abstracting program elements into scalable, reusable components that can be combined in increasingly powerful ways.This class will not cover every single capability of the language, but instead will focus on key concepts and mechanisms that will allow for tremendous new freedom and possibilities in Max. The class will touch upon:  
sound and movie playback  
sound synthesis  
sound and video effects processing  
algorithmic composition  
cross-modal mappings (e.g., video affecting audio and vice versa)  
interactive control (e.g., from QWERTY keyboard, mouse, USB devices, Open Sound Control)  
Max programming, like most interesting topics, has deep aspects and shallow aspects. This course will largely focus on the deep aspects: principles, concepts, techniques, and theory. If you understand these underlying aspects, your capacity to create in Max will deepen exponentially.At the same time, this is not just a theory class. You will also create your own projects using Max. This course will teach the minimum you need to start working on assignments, but mostly I will teach you how to learn or look up the shallow knowledge on your own using Max’s built-in documentation, the Internet, and the Kadenze course forum, as well as how to program your own tests that answer specific questions or reveal potential bugs. Working in this way, you will also develop essential skills and habits that will develop confidence and self-sufficiency, and serve you in the future.

• Common types of machine learning for making sense of human actions and sensor data, with a focus on classification, regression, and segmentation

• The “machine learning pipeline”: understanding how signals, features, algorithms, and models fit together, and how to select and configure each part of this pipeline to get good analysis results

• Off-the-shelf tools for machine learning (e.g., Wekinator, Weka, GestureFollower)

• Feature extraction and analysis techniques that are well-suited for music, dance, gaming, and visual art, especially for human motion analysis and audio analysis

• How to connect your machine learning tools to common digital arts tools such as Max/MSP, PD, ChucK, Processing, Unity 3D, SuperCollider, OpenFrameworks

• Introduction to cheap & easy sensing technologies that can be used as inputs to machine learning systems (e.g., Kinect, computer vision, hardware sensors, gaming controllers)
