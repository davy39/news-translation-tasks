We have updated our process on how to contribute to the [freeCodeCamp community YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8butISFwT-Wl7EV0hUK0BQ).

In short, we recommend reading [this guide by Beau Carnes on how we recommend creating technical courses on YouTube](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-create-a-great-technical-course/).

Once you've followed the advice there, you can reach out to Beau to discuss potentially sharing your courses with the freeCodeCamp.

Note that we also have YouTube channels for Spanish, Hindi, Chinese, and other world languages. We would welcome your help publishing courses for these. Please read Beau's guide and reach out to the [freeCodeCamp staff member](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/team) who runs that channel.
