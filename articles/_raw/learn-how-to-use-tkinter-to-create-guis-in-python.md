Do you want to create a graphic user interface for your Python program? You should learn how to use Tkinter! Tkinter is the most common way to add GUIs to Python programs.

Tkinter provides an object-oriented interface to the Tk GUI toolkit that is built-in to Python. You don't even have to install anything extra to use Tkinter.

Tkinter makes it simple to create a GUI which handles user input and output. A GUI uses a form of object oriented programming called "event-driven." This means that the program responds to events, which are actions that a user takes.

[John Elder](https://twitter.com/flatplanet) from [Codemy.com](https://codemy.com) created a 5.5 hour long comprehensive course about how to use Tkinter. We have released the full course for free on the freeCodeCamp.org YouTube channel.
