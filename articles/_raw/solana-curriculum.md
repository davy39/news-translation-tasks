The Solana Curriculum is live. You can now learn Solana's blockchain protocol and the Solana tool ecosystem interactively by building a series of projects.

This curriculum is made possible by The Solana Foundation, who gave our charity a grant to 100% fund development of this curriculum.

## What will this curriculum teach you?

The Solana curriculum contains ten interactive practice projects that will guide you through learning the Solana protocol and their tools.

Through these projects, you will learn how to build and deploy smart contracts, dApps, work with their command line tools, and much more.

There are also five challenging integrated projects to test your knowledge.

## How does it work?

The courses will run in a docker container using VS Code and the [freeCodeCamp Courses extension.](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=freeCodeCamp.freecodecamp-courses)

### Here's a Sample

## How to Run the Courses

Follow the steps below to run the courses

### Developer Environment Prerequisites
Before you get started, make sure you have these installed on your computer:

1. [Docker Engine](https://docs.docker.com/engine/)
1. [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) and the [Dev Containers](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers) extension
1. Git

### How to Run the Curriculum in Docker
Follow these instructions to clone the repo and run the courses:

1. Open a terminal and clone the [solana-curriculum](https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/solana-curriculum) repo with:
```console
git clone https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/solana-curriculum.git
```
2. Navigate to the `solana-curriculum` directory, and open it in a VSCode workspace with:
```console
code .
```

3. Press `Ctrl / Cmd + Shift + P` to open the command palette, and run `Dev Containers: Rebuild Container and Reopen in Container`. VS Code will build the container to run the projects in, it will take a few minutes the first time.
4. Once it's finished, press `Ctrl / Cmd + Shift + P` again and run `freeCodeCamp: Run Course` to start the courses. This will also take a moment.
5. The simple browser will open when it's done. If it's a blank white page, use the refresh button to update it and see the courses home page.
6. Click on one of the available projects to start a project.
7. Follow the instructions to complete the project.
8. Have fun!
