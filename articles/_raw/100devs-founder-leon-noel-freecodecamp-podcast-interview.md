On this week's episode of the podcast, I interview Leon Noel, founder of 100Devs and head of engineering at Resilient Coders.

Growing up, Leon had it drilled into him that he had to become a doctor, lawyer, or dentist. But his ambitions grew and he went on to have an exciting career in tech.

After a successful exit from a startup, Leon wanted to help folks who were struggling during the pandemic. He started 100Devs, a charity which has helped 10,000s of people learn to code.

We talk about:

* dropping out of Yale
* getting into the selective Tech Stars startup accelerator
* Getting involved with Resilient Coders, a charity that helps court-involved youth learn coding
* Starting 100Devs and building a Discord server with 60,000 people learning to code together

_I feel the same way about Leon that Wolverine does._

I recorded this podcast live and I haven't edited it at all. I want to capture the feel of a real live conversation, with all the human quirks that entails.

Can you guess what song I'm playing on my bass during the intro? It's my arrangement of the intro to a 1990s cartoon.
