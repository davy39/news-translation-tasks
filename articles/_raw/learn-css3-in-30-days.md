If you are a web developer or designer interested in learning CSS, this course is for you. Each day for 30 days, Brad Hussey will show you how to build a new project in plain, vanilla CSS3 without the use of templates, frameworks, or plugins.

By the end of the 30 days, you'll have a strong grasp on CSS3, and more importantly, the knowledge, ability, and confidence to start using CSS3 in your own projects.

There are 30 videos total, and you can complete the course at your own pace.

You can watch the first video on [the freeCodeCamp.org YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmKyG3NBY_k) (70 minute watch).‌

Check out the [CSS3 in 30 Days playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLWKjhJtqVAbl1AfjiGyYxwpdAPi5v-1OU) for every video in the course (one video will be added per day).
