In this week's episode of the podcast, freeCodeCamp founder Quincy Larson discusses AI and the future of education with Seth Goldin. 

Among other things, Seth is co-founder of College Compendium, an education charity, and studies computer science at Yale.

Also, the quote Quincy mentioned during the conversation about AI plagiarism detection software wasn't by Ben Franklin. It was William Blackstone in 1769 who said: "the law holds that it is better that 10 guilty persons escape, than that 1 innocent suffer [by being falsely convicted]."
