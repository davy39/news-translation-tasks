Are you interested in game development but don't know where to start? Do you want to create a unique and engaging game with interesting physics and artificial intelligence mechanics? If so, then our new video course is just what you need!

We just published a full course on the freeCodeCamp.org YouTube channel that will teach you how to create a game using JavaScript that uses interesting physics and AI.

Frank Dvorak developed this course. Frank is an experienced game developer and he creates fun and creative tutorials. And not only did he create the course, he created a bunch of cool art assets that he is giving away as part of this course!

_You will make this game._

The course will teach you everything you need to know to create your own 2D games using vanilla JavaScript, HTML5, CSS3, and HTML Canvas. You will learn how to implement collision detection and physics simulation, how to draw environments and characters from sprite sheets, and how to capture mouse position and animate sprites based on the player's position.

One of the key aspects of game development is creating artificial intelligence to make the game feel more alive. In this course, you will learn how to implement a simple AI to control creatures in the game, adding a whole new level of interaction and engagement for players.

We will also teach you how to control the frame rate of your game, measure time to trigger events, and implement a restart button. You will learn everything you need to know to create a complete and polished game that is both beautiful and responsive.

What sets this course apart is that we will write and understand every line of code, without relying on any external frameworks or libraries. This ensures that you have a solid foundation in game development and can build on what you've learned to create more advanced games in the future.

If you're looking to create your own game and want to learn from the ground up, then this is the course for you. Frank will guide you through every step of the process, ensuring that you come away with the skills and knowledge you need to bring your game to life.
