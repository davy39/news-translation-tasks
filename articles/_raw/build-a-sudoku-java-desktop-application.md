Want to use your Java skills to build a real-world project? How about a Sudoku game?

We just posted a full course from Ryan Kay on the freeCodeCamp.org YouTube channel that will teach you how to build a Sudoku game desktop application using Java.

Ryan uses a Sudoku Application as a teaching tool in order to explain how to design, architect, and build Java Desktop Applications.  The course is highly practical in nature, and the idea is that you follow along in your own IDE.

Here are some of the topics covered in this course:

* Problem Domain Classes
* Constants w/ Enums & static final variables
* Application Container/Entry Point
* User Interface w/ Java Interfaces
* Control Logic
* Computation Logic
* Build Logic
* Persistence/Data Storage
* Acknowledgements & further resources

Watch the course on [the freeCodeCamp.org YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qH9mWpYMtYU) (2 hour watch).
