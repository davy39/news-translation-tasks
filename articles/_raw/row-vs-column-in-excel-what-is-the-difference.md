Microsoft Excel displays data in *tabular format*. This means that information is arranged in a table consisting of rows and columns.

Rows and columns are different properties that together make up a table.

These are the two most important features of Excel that allow users to store and manipulate their data.

Below we'll discuss the definitions of a row and a column, along with the differences between these two features.


## What is a row in Excel?

Each row is denoted and identified by a unique numeric value that you'll see on the left hand side.

The row numbers are arranged vertically on the worksheet, ranging from 1-1,048,576 (you can have a total of 1,048,576 rows in Excel).

The rows themselves run horizontally on a worksheet.

Data is placed horizontally in the table, and goes across from left to right.

Row 1 is the first row in Excel.

As you can see in the example below, you can select the whole row with the number 3 by clicking on the number itself.

To navigate through the numbers and reach the last row, you can use:

- For Windows Users: `Control down navigation arrow`. You first press the Control key and then, while holding it down, press the down navigation arrow.
- For Mac Users: `Command down navigation arrow`. You first press the Command key and then, while holding it down, press the down navigation arrow.

To get back to the first row (the top) again, press `Control up navigation arrow` for Windows and `Command up navigation arrow` for Mac.


## What is a column in Excel?

Columns are denoted and identified by a unique alphabetical header letter, which is located at the top of the worksheet.

![Screenshot-2021-08-06-at-12.39.38-PM](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2021/08/Screenshot-2021-08-06-at-12.39.38-PM.jpeg)

Column headers range from A-XFD, as Excel spreadsheets can have 16,384 columns in total.

Columns run vertically in the worksheet, and the data goes from up to down.

![Screenshot-2021-08-06-at-12.39.38-PM-2](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2021/08/Screenshot-2021-08-06-at-12.39.38-PM-2.jpeg)

Column A is the first column in Excel.

In the example below, you can see that the whole column with header B is selected by pressing/clicking on the letter at the top.

To move to the last column:

- For Windows Users: `Control right navigation arrow`. First press the Control key and then, while holding it down, press the right navigation arrow.
- For Mac Users: `Command right navigation arrow`. First press the Command key and then, while holding it down, press the right navigation arrow.

To get back to the first column again, press `Control left navigation arrow` for Windows and `Command left navigation arrow` for Mac.


## What is a cell in Excel?

A cell is the intersection of a row and a column. A row and a column adjoined make up a cell.

You can define a cell by the combination of a row number and a column header.

For example, below the selected cell is C3. It has a column header C and a row number 3.

We can also select an entire row or column from a cell.

To select the whole row when in any cell, press `Shift Space`.

To select the whole column when in any cell, press `Ctrl Space`.


## Conclusion

Now you know the definitions of rows and columns in Excel. You've learned their main differences and how they work. 

In summary, information in a row is presented horizontally, whereas in a column information is vertical.

Thanks for reading!
