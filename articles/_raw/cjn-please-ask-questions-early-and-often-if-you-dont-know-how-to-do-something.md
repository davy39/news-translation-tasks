I’m currently living in the US and taking up Master of Science in Computer Science at [City University of Seattle](https://www.cityu.edu/). I’m an international student holding an F1-visa (student visa), which means i’m restricted to mostly studying at school and can’t get easily internships with the vast opportunities we have here in Seattle. Still, i have been making the most of my stay by being proactive in Seattle Tech Community by joining meetups, talks, and [hackathons](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/cashcycle-angelhack-seattle-hackathon-2018-d3f42a26ddcb). Also, i'm busy trying to materialize my vision of [building a learning and sharing community in my school](http://smartandsecurecomputing.org/clarkngo/).

_City University of Seattle_

[Educational background](https://www.linkedin.com/in/clarkngo/): I have an undergraduate degree in Finance and have 5 years experiences working in the Finance Industry and had no background in tech.

I can gain employment after my schooling. However, i doubt that companies would hire someone as a developer without an experience in developing applications given that i will have a MSCS degree.

I’ve been interested in Coding Bootcamps for quite a while i could never do a on-site bootcamp as i am not allowed to take a long vacation for my visa status and also i’m working part-time in school. Still, i didn’t want to waste time and not enter a coding bootcamp to speed up my learning in software development. And while i was looking for a bootcamp, i was learning full-stack web development in [freeCodeCamp](https://freecodecamp.com/). But i felt i needed more…

_My first full-stack learning resource =)_

After a few months, i found [Firehose Project](https://thefirehoseproject.com/) and enrolled in their online coding bootcamp. Why? I checked for reviews and I choose it simply because it includes a weekly 1-on-1 mentor session for 22 weeks. I did gain a lot of skill in full-stack web development. Created a lot of cool apps:

* [Flixter](http://flixter-clark-ngo.herokuapp.com/) — Video streaming platform
* [Grammable](http://grammable-clark-ngo.herokuapp.com/) — Instagram clone built in test-driven development
* [Todoster](https://todoster-clark-ngo.herokuapp.com/) — Todo list application with dynamic content

The truly enriching experience was the mentor sessions. Each session i would learn tips and tricks that helps you think and work as a software developer. My mentor would always be crazy optimistic for me to be a great software developer and that what really inspired me to push forward as there were times i felt down and did not feel like a person who could be a software developer.

_Mr. Miyagi me please!_

> _**Pro Tip: Please ask questions early and often if you don’t know how to do something.**_

Since day one. There have been several times that this phrase has been used by my mentor. When?

* Working on a problem and being stuck for more than an hour.
* Forgetting to ask questions when something is ambiguous.

Reminders before asking questions:

* Try fixing the problem first.
* Google before you ask.
* Read the official documentation first, before using Stackoverflow.

_Skills leveled-up: asking the right questions and googling for information and answers._

> _**Pro Tip: Read instructions two times or more.**_

This happened to me more than twice. I was building a simple program for image blur challenges. I ended up coding the solution for the 1st image blur challenge when the instructions clearly said: _for the first challenge, please copy the code._ I was so embarrassed with my mentor for this.

* Read, read, read.
* Understand, understand, understand.

_Skills leveled-up:_ reading _instructions correctly._

> _**Pro Tip: Only push working code.**_

Working on my individual project with my mentor. I thought it will be like: _hey, here’s the code i’m working on so far._ Turns out, i’m responsible for submitting a working code with tests. He was training me already on how to work in real software development team.

* Write your test first.
* Don’t submit broken code.
* Connect your PR to an issue.
* Always be detailed and clear in your comments.

I’d stop babbling here and instead list more awesome tips i got =) :

_More tips!_

On application development and code management:

> _Pro Tip: 1st rule of application development. MAKE IT WORK._

> _Pro Tip: Focus on the small functions with single responsibility. 5 lines or less._

> _Pro Tip: Refactor your code._

> _Pro Tip: Smaller commits are way easier to reverse with git._

> _Pro Tip: Commit and push, early and often._

> _Pro Tip: Quality trumps Speed._

On working with teams:

> _Pro Tip: A good team is a team that listen to others and not dismiss what others have to say, others have a voice._

> _Pro Tip: Bad team is people working in silos._

> _Pro Tip: At least 1 other person should test/review before PR._

> _Pro Tip: Help person A’s work, not work on person’s A work._

On working with feature branches:

> _Pro Tip: Feature branch should be derived from master branch._

> _Pro Tip: Always check if newly created feature branch has the latest working code with `git pull master`._

> _Pro Tip: add and commit before going to a different branch_

> _Pro Tip: Don’t need to worry on other branches, focus on your branch._

> _Pro Tip: If you messed up your local branch, raise your hand and ask for help._

On working with users stories:

> _Pro Tip: user story is just high-level framework._

> _Pro Tip: Detailed implementations is bad for user stories._

> _Pro Tip: Do the users stories in order or tasks will spiral out and be unorganized._

> _Pro Tip: One should have at most 3 user stories in progress._

> _Pro Tip: Multiple PRs outstanding. Not Good._

On tests:

> _Pro Tip: Always write isolated tests._

> _Pro Tip: Stay away from using global variables in both test and implementation code._

> _Pro Tip: Putting test logic in configuration file is bad._
