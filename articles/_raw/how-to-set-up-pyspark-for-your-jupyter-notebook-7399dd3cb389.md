[Apache Spark](https://spark.apache.org/) is one of the hottest frameworks in data science. It realizes the potential of bringing together both Big Data and machine learning. This is because:

* Spark is fast (up to 100x faster than traditional [Hadoop MapReduce](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/hadoop/hadoop_mapreduce.htm)) due to in-memory operation.
* It offers robust, distributed, fault-tolerant data objects (called [RDDs](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/apache_spark/apache_spark_rdd.htm))
