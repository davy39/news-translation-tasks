Learn how to build an expense organizer with the Dropbox API and JavaScript ES6! 

Dropbox is a content and collaboration platform. It's API allows you to add Dropbox features to your apps, such as file storage, sharing, previews, and search.

In this video course, Christian Jensen uses Scrima.com to demonstrate how to build an organizer app while teaching the fundamentals of working with the Dropbox API. You will also learn several ES6 concepts, like array methods and async/await functions. 

You can watch the full video course on the [freeCodeCamp.org YouTube channel](https://youtu.be/AzCQrjWQJs4) (1 hour watch).
