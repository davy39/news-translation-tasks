I am a self-taught designer with no formal training. No art school, no private courses, not even MOOCs. Nada. But not everything I know about design today I owe to myself. To the contrary—collaborating and learning from others has been key to my progress.

#### Get out of the building

When I first started out, I went to all sorts of industry events, conferences, and seminars. In the beginning, I just wanted to hang out and get free pizza. Not necessarily learn anything.

As I made the rounds to different events, though, I began bumping into more experienced designers**.** They told me about [structural grids](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grid_(graphic_design)), [vertical rhythm](http://webdesign.tutsplus.com/articles/improving-layout-with-vertical-rhythm--webdesign-14070) and [negative space](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negative_space) — concepts I hadn’t even heard of. They showed me [D3.js](https://d3js.org), [Sketch](http://www.sketchapp.com) and [The Noun Project](https://thenounproject.com) — tools I had no idea even existed.

That’s also how I stumbled upon hackathons: open-plan workspaces packed with smart people, coffee, and… more pizza! I loved it. That setup was perfect for getting quality, real-time feedback. Whatever I designed, I could get feedback on the spot from experienced designers to find out whether it was any good.

Most importantly, though, I made friends. We talked, we collaborated, we brainstormed—long past the events where we met. Crucially, we gave each other moral support. It helped us all overcome the moments of self-doubt that inevitably crept in. And there were many.

#### Travel to learn

About a year in, I decided to make my first trip to Silicon Valley. I was running out of cash, and starting to doubt whether my transatlantic voyage had been a good idea. As it turned out, I shouldn’t have worried — in the next month, I ended up learning more than I’d learned _in the previous year_.

It wasn’t just the quality of events that made a difference. Maybe it was because I didn’t know anyone, but I really went that extra mile to say hello to strangers.

After that initial experience, I resolved to keep traveling. Wherever I went — from London to Bangkok — I joined co-working spaces and signed up for events. Predictably, not all cities offered as much expertise as Silicon Valley. But I learnt something new everywhere.

Travel also gave me the first taste of working remotely. As I was Skyping with clients one thing became clear: to design well I needed to communicate even better. I learnt to ask more precise questions, get to the point faster and call out BS without missing a beat. Given the circumstances, I had no choice. But that’s not something you typically learn by reading a book.

#### Get help, give help

Even as I was working from home, I couldn’t escape the influence of others. For example, early on, when I wasn’t able to tell if my designs would function as intended, I would borrow ideas from Dribbble or Behance.

It didn’t help my designs stand out. But over time I internalized hundreds of different solutions, patterns, and other neat tricks.

Eventually, I started creating original designs and sharing them as well. Soon enough, young designers and entrepreneurs started asking me to audit _their_ work.

The conversations we had further organized my knowledge, and would often lead to new, unexpected ideas.

I improved my own skills by helping others improve theirs.

#### Learn with others

If you are considering learning a new profession or teaching yourself a new skill, try doing so with other people. The satisfaction of learning will be just as great — if not greater — and you will probably discover ideas you wouldn’t have come across otherwise.

Who knows, you might even land a gig or two.

I certainly did.
