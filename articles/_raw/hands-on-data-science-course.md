One of the highest paying job titles in America is "Data Scientist". If you know about data science, it could open up a lot of career opportunities. 

We've released a hands-on course on the freeCodeCamp.org YouTube channel that will teach you the basics of data science. The course will teach you about the theory and code behind the most common algorithms used in data science.

This course was developed by Marco Peixeiro. Marco is an experienced data scientist and teacher.

In this course you will learn what data science is and how to get your computer set up for data science. You will also learn the theory and practical implementation of common algorithms used in data science.
