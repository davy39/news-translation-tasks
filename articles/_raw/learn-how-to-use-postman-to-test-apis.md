Anyone who creates APIs should also be testing APIs. One of the most popular ways to test APIs is to use Postman. Postman has over 10 million users worldwide. 

We just published a Postman crash course on the freeCodeCamp.org YouTube channel that will teach you everything you need to know to start easily testing your APIs.

Valentin Despa created this course. Valentin is a developer educator who has been teaching software concepts for many years.

In this course you will learn how to build API requests with Postman and how to inspect responses and create workflows. The second part of the course will get into the most exciting feature of Postman: writing API tests and automating their execution.

You will learn about the collection runner, Postman monitors, and Newman. You will get hands-on experience and will have plenty opportunities to practice. There are assignments that will help you master the content.
