UML is a standard way to diagram computer systems or databases.

UML helps developers visualize the relationships between different pieces of software or hardware so they can more easily plan development. 

## What does UML Stand for? A UML Definition in Plain English

UML stands for Unified Modeling Language. IBM engineer Grady Booch and his team invented UML in 1994, and it quickly became a standard diagramming method.

Almost all software developers should have some understanding of UML. So we just published an in-depth UML course on the freeCodeCamp.org YouTube channel.

This course will teach you all about the most widely used UML diagrams, their basic notation, and their applications.

Ave Coders created this course. It uses plenty of diagrams and examples to help you fully understand the concepts.

Here are all the sections covered in this course:

* Overview of the main Diagrams in UML 2.0
* Class Diagram
* Component Diagram
* Deployment Diagram
* Object Diagram
* Package Diagram
* Composite Structure Diagram
* Profile Diagram
* Use Case Diagram
* Activity Diagram
* State Machine Diagram
* Sequence Diagram
* Communications Diagram
* Interaction Overview Diagram
* Timing Diagram
