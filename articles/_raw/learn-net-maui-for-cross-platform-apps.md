Are you looking to develop cross-platform desktop and mobile applications? If so, we have just the course for you!

We just published a full course on the freeCodeCamp.org YouTube channel that will teach you the essential skills you need to build your own mobile applications using .NET MAUI.

Frank Liu created this course. Frank is a full stack developer with about 20 years of development experience.

Throughout the course, you will learn how to create a Contacts app from scratch, using .NET MAUI. You will start with an introduction to .NET MAUI and learn how it compares to Xamarin Forms. Next, you will set up your development environment and create your first project.

From there, the course will guide you through the project structure, the three elements of stateful .NET MAUI, and page, layout, and view namespaces. You will also learn about URL-based navigation and the basics of ListView and data binding.

The course will then dive deeper into ListView and cover events handling, parameters in URL-based navigation, and using static repositories. You will also learn about stack layout for the Edit Contact page and view contact details, and update contact information.

In addition, the course covers more advanced topics such as Observable Collection, field validation with .NET MAUI CommunityToolkit, and creating reusable controls. You will also learn about grid layout and context actions, as well as how to use MenuItems in ListView and add a SearchBar in .NET MAUI.

By the end of the course, you will have gained the skills and knowledge necessary to build your own mobile applications with .NET MAUI. This course is perfect for anyone looking to develop cross-platform desktop and mobile applications using .NET MAUI.
