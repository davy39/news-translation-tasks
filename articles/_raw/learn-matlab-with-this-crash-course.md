MATLAB is a programming language and software suite used for data analysis, scientific computing, and visualization that is widely used in academia and industry. 

We just published a MATLAB crash course on the freeCodeCamp.org YouTube channel that will teach you the fundamentals of MATLAB.

Phillip Parisi developed this course. Phil is a PhD engineering student and his teaching style is clear and to the point.

MATLAB is used in a wide range of industries including aerospace, automotive, telecommunications, finance, and medical imaging. It is also used in educational and research institutions to teach and conduct research in mathematics, science, and engineering.

Here are the sections in this course:

* MATLAB IDE
* Variables & Arithmetic
* Matrices, Arrays, & Linear Algebra
* The Index
* Example 1 - Equations
* Anonymous Functions
* Example 2 - Plotting
* Example 3 - Logic
* Example 4 - Random & Loops
* Sections
* For Loops
* Calculation Time
* Naming Conventions
* File Naming
* While Loop
* Custom Function
