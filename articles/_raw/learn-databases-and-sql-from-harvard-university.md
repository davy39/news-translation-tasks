Are you ready to master the art of data management using one of the most essential languages in the world of computing? Introducing CS50 SQL, Harvard University's focused video course dedicated to an introduction to databases using a language called SQL.

This course is created by Carter Zenke, and offers a unique and immersive learning experience that will help you develop the skills you need to excel in managing and manipulating data.

We just posted the entire course on the [freeCodeCamp.org](http://freeCodeCamp.org) YouTube channel.

This SQL-focused course offers a deeper dive into relational databases, covering essential topics such as how to create, read, update, and delete data (CRUD), as well as modeling real-world entities.

Here's an overview of the course sections:

* Querying
    
* Relating
    
* Designing
    
* Writing
    
* Viewing
    
* Optimizing
    
* Scaling
    

The CS50 SQL course offers an extensive range of hands-on opportunities for practice, with assignments inspired by real-world datasets. You'll learn how to normalize data to eliminate redundancies, join tables using primary and foreign keys, automate searches with views, and expedite them with indexes. The course begins with SQLite for portability and ends with introductions to PostgreSQL and MySQL for scalability.
