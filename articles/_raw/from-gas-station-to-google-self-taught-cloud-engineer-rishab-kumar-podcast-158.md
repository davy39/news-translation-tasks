On this week's episode of the podcast, freeCodeCamp founder Quincy Larson interviews Rishab Kumar, cloud engineer and developer advocate at Twillio.

Rishab grew up in India and moved to Canada for school. But he couldn't afford to finish. He resorted to delivering pizzas and working at a gas station. But he worked hard to teach himself how to code and how to build cloud infrastructure, and eventually got a job Google.

We talk about:

* How to teach yourself cloud engineering
    
* Getting repeatedly rejected from FAANG jobs but persisting
    
* Filling up the Infinity Gauntlet with cloud certifications
    
* How DevOps and Cloud Engineering are changing
