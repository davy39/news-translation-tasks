Learn to build AI agents with Langbase.

We just posted a course on the freeCodeCamp.org YouTube channel that will teach you how to create context-engineered agents that use memory and AI primitives to take action and deliver accurate, production-ready results using Langbase.

Langbase is a powerful serverless AI cloud for building and deploying AI agents. A great alternative to bloated frameworks, Langbase gives you simple AI primitives including Pipes, Memory (RAG), Workflows, and Tools, allowing you to easily build, deploy, and scale serverless AI agents.

Context-engineered agents are AI agents powered by LLMs and enhanced with tools and long-term memory (Agentic RAG). Instead of only responding to prompts, they can also:

* Retrieve knowledge from documents and data.
    
* Take real-world actions with tools.
    
* Maintain workflows and context across conversations.
    

In this course, you’ll:

* Create your first Agentic RAG system using Langbase Pipes and memory agents.
    
* Deploy and scale serverless agents in Langbase Studio.
    
* Vibe code AI agents using Command.new.
    

The course covers:

* Explaining context engineering and the agentic RAG pipeline.
    
* Building memory agents.
    
* Using Langbase AI primitives including Workflow, Parser, Chunker, Embed, and Memory to build any type of AI agent.
    
* Deploying and scaling serverless AI agents without frameworks.
