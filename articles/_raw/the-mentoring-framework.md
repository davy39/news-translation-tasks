Last October I created a Mentoring Framework at work. The goal was to create a project from scratch using Ruby on Rails. And on that journey I wanted to learn more about Ruby, front end development, Project Management and Git, Databases, and DevOps.

This Mentoring Framework is similar to what bootcamps do. The difference here is that I am sharing a list of suggested features / things to learn and each person can focus in what is important for them.

**In a nutshell: Goals → Project → Execution → Knowledge (and profit).**

The article is divided into 4 main sections: Before you start, Project ideas, Execution, and Examples and Resources.

## Before you start

What are your main goals? For the following list, pick the level of knowledge you'd like to gain: "basic understanding", "intermediate understanding", or "advanced understanding". This will help to identify where you are going to invest more time and energy.

* Learn Ruby / Ruby on Rails
* Learn about the front end
* Learn Project Management and Git
* Learn Databases
* Learn DevOps

## Project ideas

Once you know your main goals, you need a project. Check out the following two ideas:

### Book store

Imagine you want to sell books online. What kind of features does a bookstore have?

* List books per title
* List books per authors
* List books per categories
* Search books
* Buy books
* List your orders

### Pet adoption website

Imagine you want to create a website for an organisation that takes care of animals (in British Columbia we have the SPCA). What kind of features does a pet adoption website have?

* List pets per type (dog, cat and others)
* List pets per size (or breed, or age)
* List pets per location
* Search pet per name
* Request an adoption
* List your adoption requests

## Execution

Once you know your main goals and you have an idea, it is time to work. Check the list of tasks you will be doing:

### Learn Ruby on Rails

* Use scaffolds to create your entities (basic understanding) or create your own controllers, models and views (intermediate)
* Add authentication with Devise (basic understanding) or create your own (intermediate). Or use Devise with Oauth authentication (Facebook, Google, etc - intermediate)
* Add friendly URLs with a gem (basic) or create your own solution (intermediate)
* Add search (intermediate)
* Add tests for all your code
* Create seeds for your data so you don't need to manually create data
* Send emails to users (intermediate)
* Create different user roles (intermediate)
* Add pagination (basic)
* Add localization (intermediate)
* Add a tag system (intermediate)
* Add images (intermediate)

### Learn about the front end

* Use Tailwind CSS (basic) or your own CSS/SASS (intermediate) to create a beautiful layout
* Use Turbolinks (advanced / optional)
* Add basic animations - for example, when adding a book in the cart show some animation (advanced/optional)
* Add Google Maps in your app (intermediate)
* Add Google Places in your users
* Add a carousel with photos
* Add Pagination with Ajax or endless pagination (advanced)

### Learn Project Management and Git

* Use Github Project to organize your features
* Use feature branches in Git, create PR for all your features

### Learn Databases

Write plain SQL to find relevant information. A few examples:

* Find best-sellers authors in the book store
* Find the number of orders or pet requests per city
* Find which day has more sales
* Add charts in your app to expose the data

### Learn DevOps

* Deploy the website to Heroku (basic/intermediate) or AWS (advanced)
* Setup CI in Heroku (basic/intermediate)
* Add Airbrake to monitor errors in your app (basic)
* Buy a domain, set up Cloudflare (advanced/optional)
