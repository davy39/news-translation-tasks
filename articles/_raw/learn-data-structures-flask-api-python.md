People often learn about data structures out-of-context. It can be helpful to see how they are used in a real-world project.

We just published a course on the freeCodeCamp.org YouTube channel that will help you learn foundational data structure concepts by building a real-world API using Python and Flask.

This course was developed by Georgio Tunson. He has a knack for helping people understand data structures in a practical way.

The only prerequisite for this course is a basic understanding of Python. You will learn about how to install Python & Flask, configure a database, and to implement API routes using many popular data structures.

Here are the topics covered in this course:

* Install Python & Flask
* Database Setup & API Skeleton
* Install Database Browser
* Linked List
* Install Postman
* Hash Table
* Binary Search Tree
* Stacks and Queues

Watch the full course below or on [the freeCodeCamp.org YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74NW-84BqbA) (3-hour watch).
