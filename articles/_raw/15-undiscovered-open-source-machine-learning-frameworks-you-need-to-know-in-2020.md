Machine Learning (ML) is one of the fastest emerging technologies today. And the application of machine learning to different areas of computing is gaining popularity rapidly.

This is not only because of the existence of cheap and powerful hardware. It's also because of the increasing availability of [**free and open-source**](https://opensource.com/resources/what-open-source) [**Machine learning**](https://machinelearningmastery.com/types-of-learning-in-machine-learning/) **frameworks**, which allow developers to implement machine learning easily.

This wide range of open-source machine learning frameworks let data scientists and machine learning engineers build, implement and maintain machine learning systems, generate new projects, and create new and impactful machine learning systems.

Choosing a Machine Learning Framework or library to solve your use case involves making an assessment to decide what is right for your use case. Several factors are important for this assessment such as:

* Ease of use.
* Support in the market (Community).
* Running Speeds.
* Openness.

### **Who’s this article for?**

This article is for those who want to use the knowledge in practice after learning the theory.

It's also for those who want to explore other potential open-source machine learning frameworks for their future ML project.

Now here is the list of undiscovered and open-source frameworks or libraries that businesses and individuals can use to build machine learning systems.
