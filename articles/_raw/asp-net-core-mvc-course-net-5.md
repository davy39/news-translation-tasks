ASP.NET Core is a cross-platform framework for building Internet-connected apps. With ASP.NET Core running on .NET, you can build web apps and services, Internet of Things (IoT) apps, and mobile backends.

We've released 2½ hour [course](https://youtu.be/Pi46L7UYP8I) for beginners that will help you learn about developing applications in ASP.NET Core 5 using MVC. This course was developed by Bhrugen Patel.

After learning about the history and basics of ASP.NET Core, you will learn how to build a small book list application with CRUD operations. You will also learn how to use the Entity Framework for integration with a database with ASP.NET Core Razor Pages. 

After building a CRUD application with validations you will learn how to deploy the application on Azure! You will learn how quick it can be to create a functional business website.
