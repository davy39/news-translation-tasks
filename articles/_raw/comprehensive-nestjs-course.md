NestJS is a progressive Node.js framework for building efficient, reliable, and scalable server-side applications using TypeScript and JavaScript. 

Learning NestJS can significantly enhance your ability to create structured, maintainable, and testable backend applications, offering a robust toolkit that integrates seamlessly with other modern technologies and methodologies.

We just posted a comprehensive NestJS course on the freeCodeCamp.org YouTube channel. This course, crated by the experienced Haider Malik, will help you master the creation of robust backend APIs for real-world applications.

In this course, Haider Malik, a seasoned web developer and open-source advocate, will guide you through the process of developing Spotify clone backend. Starting from database design to REST API development and deployment, this course is structured to provide a deep understanding of backend architecture using a blend of NestJS, Node.js, PostgreSQL, and MongoDB.

The course contains multiple modules, each designed to tackle different aspects of backend development with NestJS. From understanding the basics of NestJS, creating REST APIs, handling middlewares and exception filters, to implementing authentication and authorization, the course is a deep dive into backend development.

Further modules cover advanced topics like connecting with databases using TypeORM, implementing relationships in databases, and securing APIs with JWT authentication. Learners will also get hands-on experience with migrations, seeding, debugging, and even deploying NestJS applications to cloud services.

The course does not stop at REST APIs; it also introduces GraphQL, showcasing how to build and authenticate GraphQL APIs. Advanced concepts like WebSocket integration, file handling, custom decorators, and even real-time subscriptions with GraphQL are covered, ensuring learners are well-versed in the latest backend development practices.
