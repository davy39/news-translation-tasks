RWD is important because it allows your website to be accessible to everyone, no matter what device they're using.

## Why Does RWD Matter For My Business?

These days, more and more people are using their mobile devices to browse the web. 

In fact, according to [Statista](https://www.statista.com/statistics/277125/share-of-website-traffic-coming-from-mobile-devices/), mobile devices accounted for more than 50% of global internet usage this year. That’s more than half! And it's only going to increase as technology becomes even more advanced.

As you can see, your business needs to be accessible anywhere, on any device – and responsive design is the best way to make that happen. 

If you have a website that is not responsive, you're losing out on valuable traffic from mobile users because they will bounce off your site immediately if they can't view it properly on their phone or tablet.

## How Does Responsive Web Design Benefit Me And My Customers?

A responsive website provides a better user experience, which can lead to more customers and conversions. 

Responsive websites aren't just beneficial for businesses. They also provide benefits to consumers. With a single touch or click of their mouse, users can access whatever they need from whichever device they prefer – be it their laptop, tablet or phone.

If you're like most business owners, you want to make sure your website is accessible to as many people as possible. That's why responsive design is so important. 

Responsive sites are also easier to maintain because you can make content updates on one version and it'll automatically be reflected on all screens. This can save you time and money in the long run.

## How to Get Started with Responsive Web Design

Having a responsive design is paramount for attracting new clients. While it may seem difficult, I assure you that you can do it!

Here are a few simple steps you can take in order to start becoming responsive today:

1. Start by redesigning your site with images and content scaled for smaller screens such as tablets and smartphones. This way, you will be ahead of the curve when mobile use starts dominating the market. 
2. Write your content responsively.
3. Use `CSS` media queries so that you can display different styling based on the device being used to view the site. The `CSS` code below will serve as an example: 

```css
@media only screen and (max-width: 768px){...} 
```

When the screen shrinks to less than 768px, each column should have a width of 95%:

```css
@media only screen and (max-width: 768px) {
  /* For mobile phones: */
  [class*="col-"] {
    width: 95%;
  }
}
```

Checkout the following [code](https://codepen.io/gatwirival/pen/qBYBRXa). You can play around with it to learn more about media queries.

4.  Convert all your fonts into [web fonts](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/Styling_text/Web_fonts), which are faster loading and much more compatible across browsers than other fonts. You might also consider investing in a [retina ready logo and site design](https://designmodo.com/responsive-retina-images/). 

5.  Add social media icons to your site so people visiting from mobile devices can share your content with friends. 

6.  Enable any videos or slideshows on your website to auto play once they load instead of making users click first. This helps ensure that people don't exit out before viewing important information. 

7.  Make sure your navigation menu uses clear language and large buttons for easy access no matter what size screen is being used. 

8.  When adding links, think about how you would navigate the site on a smartphone or tablet to help increase usability for those browsing from these small screens.

9.  Test your website regularly to make sure everything looks good and functions properly across various types of devices.

## Timing Is Everything!

You may be wondering if responsive website design is worth the investment. After all, your current website might be getting the job done just fine.
