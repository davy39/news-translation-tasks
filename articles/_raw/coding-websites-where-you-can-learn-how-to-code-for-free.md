In this day and age, it seems like everyone is learning to code. Maybe you want to know how websites work, or you think back fondly on the old blogging platforms where you could hack together some HTML to personalize them.

Or maybe you are curious to learn what all this coding craze is about so you can get started developing apps and websites yourself.

If that's the case, then this article can help you figure out where to start.

## Why – and How – Should You Teach Yourself Coding?

Coding is a field that is accessible to everyone. And to get a tech job, you don't necessarily need a degree from an expensive university. As long as you are able to show that you are good at coding, you can get a job. 

Tech is so accessible partly because of all the free resources you can use to teach yourself to code. But this can also be a challenge: how do you navigate through all these courses, articles, bootcamps, and discussion threads?

It's usually a good idea to choose one main resource from which to start learning. It can be a curriculum or an ordered list of topics, whatever works for you. Then follow that plan. 

It's ok to make brief detours and use other materials that might help you out when you're stuck, but try to do that only if the resources you have are not enough. 

When you finish a curriculum or a course, you may be tempted to start another one on the same topic right away. But instead of doing that, you should build projects with what you just learned to learn it better. 

You will likely have enough basic knowledge to build simple projects, and in the process you'll figure out what you know and don't know.

To help you find some learning resources that are right for you, in this article I'll share various websites where you can learn to code for free. 

I've used most these tools myself while learning to code, and I use some of them even now. And if I haven't personally used them, I made sure to choose resources that have really positive feedback.

# freeCodeCamp.org

If you are here, you may have noticed that this is freeCodeCamp's publication. Here at [freecodecamp.org/news](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/) there are thousands of articles on programming and related topics that you may find really useful along your learning path.

You can bookmark these articles to help you learn new topics or find different explanations for topics you are struggling with.

Also, the [freeCodeCamp learning platform](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) has a full-stack web development curriculum based on the MERN stack (Mongo, Express, React, NodeJS), and an expanding curriculum on Python and Data Science. 

The [freeCodeCamp forum](https://forum.freecodecamp.org/) is also a really friendly place to get help with the curriculum and programming help in general.

Finally, the [FreeCodeCamp YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8butISFwT-Wl7EV0hUK0BQ) has thousands of hours of video tutorials on various programming topics. It has a much wider variety of topics than the curriculum, so if you are not interested in web devoplment, or want to look at other specific topics in more detail, definitely check the YouTube channel out.
