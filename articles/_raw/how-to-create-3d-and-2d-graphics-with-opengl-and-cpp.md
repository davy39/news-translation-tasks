OpenGL is a cross-language, cross-platform graphics API for rendering 2D and 3D scenes using a graphics card.

We just released a course on the freeCodeCamp.org YouTube channel that will teach you how to use OpenGL with C++ to create 3D and 2D graphics.

Victor Gordan developed this course. His course is great for beginners. It features simple-to-follow instructions and informative diagrams.

The course will take you from installing the needed software all the way to creating your own graphics and importing models.
