On this week's episode of the podcast, freeCodeCamp founder Quincy Larson interviews Emma Bostian. She's a software engineer turned manager at Spotify and Prolific coding teacher.

We talk about:

* How at her first developer job at IBM, Emma's boss told her: "You need to get your stuff together or you won't make it in this industry." And the transformation that followed.
    
* Emma's thoughts on Computer Science degrees. "Going to college gives you credibility and a network. You can get opportunities that way."
    
* How Emma hires software engineers. (Hint: she tries to disregard degrees completely.)
    
* How Emma intentionally procrastinates some big tasks to give her mind time to figure out the puzzle pieces
    

Can you guess what song I'm playing on my bass during the intro? It's from a 1979 punk song.
