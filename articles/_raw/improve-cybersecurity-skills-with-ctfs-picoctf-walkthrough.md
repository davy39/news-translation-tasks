Want to improve your cybersecurity / ethical hacking skills but don't know where to start? Cyber Security Capture The Flag (CTF) games are the perfect place to practice and learn. 

picoCTF is a beginner's level computer security game that consists of a series of challenges  where participants must reverse engineer, break, hack, decrypt, or do whatever it takes to solve the challenge. The challenges are all set up with the intent of being hacked, making it an excellent, legal way to get hands-on experience with cybersecurity. 

John Hammond has created a video walkthrough on how to solve the challenges from the picoCTF 2018 game. Consider trying to solve the challenges on your own first, then watch how to solve them.

You can watch the walkthrough video on the [freeCodeCamp.org YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIkxsBgkpj8) (6 hour watch).‌
