Spreadsheet software like Microsoft Excel is used by everyone from office workers to data scientists. Excel gives a lot of power to people working with data, but it can also be intimidating.

We've released a full course on the freeCodeCamp.org YouTube channel that will teach you how to use Microsoft Excel from the beginning. You will learn by creating 6 real-world projects. Most of the content applies to Google Sheets as well.

The course was created by Shad Sluiter. Shad is a professor of computer science at Grand Canyon University. Over the past 20 years he has taught students from grade 6 to senior citizens in many aspects of technology.

Excel is one of the most used tools in business, engineering, accountancy and many more industries. It helps you organize and manipulate a large amount of data which can be otherwise time-consuming, mundane, and difficult to organize.

If you are in the business sector, learning Excel is a necessity. It helps you manage inventory, human resources, and finances.

In this Excel course, you will learn how to:

* enter data,
* navigate through a spreadsheet,
* create formulas to solve problems,
* create charts and graphs,
* understand relative vs absolute references,
* import and export data,
* implement VLOOKUP,
* use pivot tables,
* split and concatenate text,
* and more.
