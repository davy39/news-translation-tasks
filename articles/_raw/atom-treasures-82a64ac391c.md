#### a list of Atom plugins I can’t live without

I recently switched from [Sublime Text 3](https://www.sublimetext.com/) to [Atom Editor](https://atom.io/), and I must say it sped up my development process especially the part of producing flawless front-end code.

### What’s Atom Editor?

**As stated on their homepage:** Atom is a text editor that’s modern, approachable, yet hackable to the core — a tool you can customize to do anything but also use productively without ever touching a config file

### What made me switch to Atom Editor?

First of all, it’s backed by [Github](https://github.com/). Github is a successful company that focuses on developers needs regarding version control and product development.

> _Github has a lot of resources to put in the process of developing an application. It has the ability to create a stable product fast and improve it over time._

Second, it’s hackable to the core this allows us (developers) to build new packages for everything from theming and synchronization to the way we write characters on screen.

It’s also inspectable by the chrome inspector because it’s made with [Electron](http://electron.atom.io/) a cross-platform framework to create desktop apps with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS also by Github

### The list

#### [Minimap](https://atom.io/packages/minimap)

Minimap provides you with a preview of the full source code; this is nice to gain an overview of the file you are editing.

#### [Minimap cursor line](https://atom.io/packages/minimap-cursorline)

It’s good to know where you are in your file, cursor line allows you to see where in your file you are. It moves with you if you move lines.

#### [Pigments](https://atom.io/packages/pigments)

_You can sync your snippets, keymap and other settings_

Here is my [packages.json](https://gist.githubusercontent.com/0x1ad2/3dcc76bd77334753c9993f2be38ebac3/raw/05b0eac18ae85b9ae346c45b3c0e74ff287db808/packages.json) file, copy it for quickly installing the packages mentioned above (and more).

[Matthew Leonard](https://medium.com/@matt1222?source=responses---------0-) was wondering how to use it so here’s a little guide

* Installing the [plugin](https://github.com/atom-community/sync-settings) trough package management
* Creating a Github token with the right access
* Create a Gist file
* Set the tokens and last part of the URL from the Gist file in the package settings
* Use Ctrl-Shift-P (or Cmd-Shift-P) and type sync to back-up and restore the packages

#### [WakaTime](https://atom.io/packages/wakatime)

Because who don’t want to track their time per project? ☺️

WakaTime allows you to track your time per project, your programming languages used, logged in time and much more. All you have to do install the plugin and grab a API key from [https://wakatime.com/](https://wakatime.com/)
