Flutter is a UI software development kit from Google that allows developers to build natively compiled applications for mobile, web, and desktop from a single codebase.

We've released a Flutter Essentials course on the freeCodeCamp.org YouTube channel. This beginner's course will teach you everything you need to know to get started building apps with Flutter. The course was created by MTechViral.

Flutter uses the Dart programming language, but prior Dart experience is not required to watch this course. It would be helpful to have expereince with at least one other programming language, though.

Here are some of the Flutter topics discussed in this course:

* Installation
* Container & Text Widgets
* Rows & Columns
* Material Drawer
* ListView
* Circle Avatar
* NetworkImage
* Floating Action Button
* Card, Asset Images, TextField & ScrollView
* Organising Your Flutter Code 
* Networking with HTTP
* ListView Builder
* GridView Builder
* Forms, Stack & Navigation
* Persistent Storage with Shared Preferences

By the end of this course, you will be able to start creating your own multi-platform applications with Flutter.

Watch the full 3-hour course below or on the [freeCodeCamp.org YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2IGQT3BZQo).
