Have you acquired a new monitor only to find out it's not displaying anything from your computer? Or maybe the monitor suddenly stops working? 

On many occasions, this problem is caused by a faulty generic PNP monitor driver.

Apart from driver issues, the monitor might not be working due to an improper connection associated with cables. IT could also happen because the monitor is faulty.

In response to this error, most monitors would show “No signal” or “Check connection cable”. That gives you a clue as to the first thing you should do – check the connection cables.

## How to Fix Generic PNP Monitor Issues on Windows 10

### Make sure all cables are properly connected

First, make sure all cables are connected properly. If you’re using a VGA or HDMI, or display port cable, look at the connection ports for the cables on both the monitor and computer and make sure they are not loose.

If you are sure the cables are connected the right way and the monitor still shows nothing, then you might need to switch cables. 

If you were using HDMI at first, switch to VGA or display port. And if you were using a display port but the monitor still won’t show anything, then switch to VGA or HDMI.

### How to Fix Generic PNP Monitor by Updating Drivers

If your monitor is not working, then you should update your display adapter drivers and monitor drivers.

#### How to Update the Display Adapter Driver

To update the display adapter driver, head over to the device manager by right-clicking on Start and selecting device manager.

Expand Display adapters, right-click on the device you see (mostly “Intel(R) HD Graphics…”), and select “Update driver”.

Select “Search automatically for drivers” so your computer can check the internet for the latest driver.

If the driver is really not up to date, your computer will download an updated version of the driver and prompt you to install it.

#### How to Update the Generic PnP Monitor Driver

Head over to Device driver again and expand Monitors. Right-click on Generic PnP Monitor” and select Update driver.

PnP means Plug and Play. It’s the driver your computer installs for a monitor it doesn’t recognize.

Select “Search automatically for drivers”.

Your computer will prompt you to install the updated driver once it’s downloaded.

If you update the necessary drivers and the monitor fails to work, then it’s an issue with your cable connections. This time around, you might need to get an external adapter or external converter.

### Use an External Adapter or Converter with your Connection Cables 

If you try every possible cable and the monitor still doesn’t show anything, then it might mean your monitor won’t work unless you connect a **display adapter** to the part of the cable attached to your laptop or system unit.

In that case, there are several adapters you can use:

- VGA to HDMI
- USB to HDMI
- VGA to display port

You can get the adapters from any tech store in your area or online.

On most occasions, VGA to HDMI or VGA to display port works. When I had the same issue, VGA to HDMI adapter was what worked for me.

## Final Thoughts
I hope this article helps you fix any issue you have with your monitor. 

Bear in mind that once you update the necessary drivers (Monitor driver and Display adapter driver) and the monitor still fails to display, then it's likely an issue with your connection cables.

Thank you for reading.
