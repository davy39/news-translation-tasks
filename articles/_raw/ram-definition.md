RAM, or random access memory, is a special type of computer memory.

RAM stores important information that the computer needs to access often so that everything runs smoothly. All modern computers and phones need some amount of RAM to function.

Though computers and other devices have other forms of storage like an HDD (hard disk drive) or SSD (solid state drive), RAM is much faster. In fact, RAM is about 30 times faster than modern SSDs.

While RAM is very fast, it is a type of volatile memory. This means that it only stores information while the computer is on. Unlike an HDD or SSD, once you shut down your computer, everything stored in RAM is lost.
