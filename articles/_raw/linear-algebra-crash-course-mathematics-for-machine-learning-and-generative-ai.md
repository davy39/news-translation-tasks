Linear algebra is a useful skill for professionals in data science, machine learning, and AI. We just posted a course on the freeCodeCamp.org YouTube channel that will teach you linear algebra.

This crash course spans just over 6 hours and is a great starting point for beginners. It serves as the foundation for mastering linear algebra and sets you up for success in more advanced topics.

Tatev Aslanyan created this course. She is a seasoned Data Science and AI professional with over half a decade of international experience.

The course combines academic-level material with industry insights, leveraging resources and textbooks. You'll see how university concepts seamlessly translate into practical applications. The course features practical examples, including a detailed one-hour walkthrough of solving systems of linear equations with Gaussian elimination by hand, a core technique in linear algebra.
