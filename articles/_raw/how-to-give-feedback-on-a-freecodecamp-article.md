We at the freeCodeCamp editorial team do our best to ensure articles are as accurate as they can be.

Still, we occasionally miss factual inaccuracies, non-functioning code examples, and even plagiarism from authors. And when publishing dozens of articles per week, typos are all but inevitable.

This said, all of these things can be fixed. And we will fix them. If we know that they exist.

This is where you come in. If you see something, say something. And we make this as easy as we can for you.

You can email us at editorial[at]freecodecamp[dot]org and we'll take care of the corrections.

## How to report a typo in one of freeCodeCamp's articles

If you spot a typo, all you need to do is copy the URL of the article. And if you can take a screenshot of the typo, too, that would be a huge help.

You can share the typo with us at editorial[at]freecodecamp[dot]org.

Our editorial team will go in and fix the typo as fast as we can.

## How to report broken code in one of freeCodeCamp's articles

Our editorial team does our best to catch bugs in code, but we don't catch everything.

Also, libraries become deprecated, APIs shut down, and code generally degrades with time. This is just the nature of things.

If you notice any code that has a bug in it, or no longer seems to work, you can let us know at editorial[at]freecodecamp[dot]org.

Our editorial team will go in and fix the broken code as fast as we can.

## How to report a factual inaccuracy in one of freeCodeCamp's articles

We do our best to fact-check articles during the editing process. But if one of our publication's authors got something wrong, let us know and we can investigate it.

You can share the factual inaccuracy with us at editorial[at]freecodecamp[dot]org.

Our editorial team will address any factual inaccuracies as fast as we can.

## How to report plagiarism in one of freeCodeCamp's articles

Plagiarism is when an author misrepresents someone else's work as their own. This is a form of literary theft, and we take it very seriously.

Plagiarism can come in a number of forms.

For example, some plagiarists are naive enough to try copy-pasting someone else's article or parts of their article into their own article without properly citing them.

This is usually pretty easy to catch. You can just plug paragraphs from the article into a plagiarism detection tool.

But most plagiarists are more sophisticated in their graft. They will paraphrase other people's work without properly crediting them. This is difficult to detect.

They may also take content from a video or a presentation, which isn't indexed in text form on Google or other search engines. This is extremely difficult to detect, but it can be verified once someone reports it.

freeCodeCamp has published thousands of articles over the years, and we have only had a small handful of cases of confirmed plagiarism. But it is possible there is more plagiarism lurking in our publication that no one has noticed or reported.

If you see something that looks suspicious, please err on the side of caution and report it.

You can share any instances of plagiarism with us at editorial[at]freecodecamp[dot]org.

Our editorial team will go in and investigate all reports of plagiarism thoroughly and will take swift action.

## Thank you again for helping us improve these articles.

You are the best. Have a wonderful day, and happy coding.
