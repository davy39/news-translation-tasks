The shift towards serverless architectures is rapidly becoming a pivotal aspect of application development. Even Node.js, which is traditionally used with servers, can be used to build a serverless application.

We just published a course on the freeCodeCamp.org YouTube channel that will teach you how to develop serverless applications using Node.js. You'll learn the nuances of deploying an Express.js and Node.js application to AWS Lambda. 

You'll also learn how to leverage the cutting-edge capabilities of [Neon Serverless Postgres](https://neon.tech/education) (which created a grant for freeCodeCamp to help make this course possible) and the Serverless Framework to enhance your application development and deployment strategy.

Justin Mitchel created this course. He is a popular instructor and creator of the Coding for Entrepreneurs course platform. Justin brings his extensive expertise to the table, ensuring that you not only grasp the theoretical aspects but also gain hands-on experience through a project-based learning approach. 

Here are some of the key sections in this course.

* **What Serverless Means for App Development**: A foundational overview, preparing learners for the paradigm shift in how applications are built and deployed.
* **Requirements & Tech Overview**: Familiarize yourself with the tools and technologies that will be utilized throughout the course.
* **Project Setup to Deployment**: From initial setup to running Express locally with the Serverless Framework, this course ensures a hands-on approach to mastering serverless deployment.
* **Securing and Managing Your Deployment**: Learn to secure your deployment with AWS System Manager Parameter Store and manage Neon resources efficiently with the Neon CLI.
* **Database Integration and Management**: Dive deep into [integrating NodeJS with Neon Postgres](https://neon.tech/education), managing database schemas, and automating branched Neon database secrets.
* **Advanced Deployment Techniques**: Master automated deployments via GitHub Actions and explore integration with rewrites in Next.js and Vercel, culminating in deploying Express.js to Vercel.

Serverless architectures offer unparalleled scalability and cost efficiency, allowing developers to focus on code rather than managing servers. This approach not only streamlines deployment processes but also significantly reduces operational costs, as you only pay for the compute time you use, making it an ideal solution for projects of any size.
