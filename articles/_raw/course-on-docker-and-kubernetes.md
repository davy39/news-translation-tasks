Docker and Kubernetes make it simpler to run code and software in different environments. 

Containers are a way of packaging software. Running a container is like running a virtual machine. You can use Docker to build and deploy containers and you can use Kubernetes to manage containers.

We've released a 4-hour hands-on course on the freeCodeCamp.org YouTube channel that will teach you the fundamentals of Docker and Kubernetes.

This course was developed by Nelson Jamal from Amigoscode and Nana Janashia from Techworld with Nana. These two instructors have considerable expereince teaching both on YouTube and other platforms.

In this course, you will first learn all about Docker, including images, containers, volumes, container registry, and docker architecture.  Next, you will learn about Kubernetes, including architecture, pods, services, config maps, and deployments. 

You will learn the differences between Docker and Kubernetes, allowing  you to start using these two technologies with confidence.

Here are all the topics covered in the comprehensive course:
