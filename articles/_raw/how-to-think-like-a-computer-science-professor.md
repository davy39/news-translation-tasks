Many tutorials demonstrate how to build something that the instructor has already fully planned out beforehand. But it can be helpful to see the thought process that goes into building a project completely from scratch.

We just published a course on the freeCodeCamp.org YouTube channel that will demonstrate how an experienced developer codes a project from scratch.

In this course, Radu Mariescu-Istodor will teach you how to think like a computer science professor. Radu has a PhD in computer science. He teaches computer science at a university as well as on his YouTube channel.

Over the course of thirteen hours, Radu builds a talking avatar with face tracking – and he does it all without even referencing the Internet. 

Can you imagine building a fully functional program without looking at StackOverflow even once? 🤣 Radu does just that.

Watch the full course below or on the freeCodeCamp.org YouTube channel (13-hour watch).
