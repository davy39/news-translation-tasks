Embark on an exciting journey to learn the fundamentals of reinforcement learning and its implementation using Gymnasium, the open-source Python library previously known as OpenAI Gym.

We just published a full course on the freeCodeCamp.org YouTube channel that will teach you the basics of reinforcement learning using Gymnasium.

Mustafa Esoofally created this course. He is an experienced machine learning engineer and course creator.

Gymnasium is an open source Python library maintained by the Farama Foundation. It offers a rich collection of pre-built environments for reinforcement learning agents, a standard API for communication between learning algorithms and environments, and a standard set of environments compliant with that API. This comprehensive video course is designed to help you understand reinforcement learning, a branch of machine learning that focuses on intelligent agents taking actions in an environment to maximize cumulative rewards.

### Course Contents

This video course is carefully structured to provide you with a complete understanding of reinforcement learning, from basics to advanced topics:
