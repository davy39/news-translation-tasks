Back when [massive open online courses](https://www.class-central.com/help/moocs) (MOOCs) were new, I started a project to complete the equivalent of an MBA, using free courses. Platforms such as Coursera and edX were making headlines, and when I learned that leading universities (including business schools) were distributing online courses for free, I was inspired to construct a business education rather than pay an exorbitant amount for a degree.

I called the project the “No-Pay MBA” and I blogged about it at [www.NoPayMBA.com](http://www.nopaymba.com/). I finished my business education in 2016, and wrote a book to guide others interested in doing a self-made MBA ([_Don’t Pay For Your MBA_, HarperCollins, 2017](https://amzn.to/2CW1W6k)).

Now that I’m working for the MOOC review site [Class Central](https://www.class-central.com/), I’ve been wondering, how would I approach this project today, given the wealth of new courses and tools that are now available?

When I was doing my No-Pay MBA, there were only a few business MOOCs available, so I basically signed up for all of them. Fortunately or unfortunately, so many respected business schools have released free courses — 1,867 [business courses](https://www.class-central.com/subject/business) are currently listed on Class Central — that it would be impossible to do that today.

Through my studies, I also came to believe that putting together an MBA-level education requires much more than simply ticking through a checklist of course topics. That’s partly because MOOCs differ from on-campus courses in scope, length, and rigor; and partly because creating your own MBA offers a tremendous opportunity to tailor the curriculum to your needs.

My advice: start by learning some foundational business concepts in introductory-level courses, then develop some general business skills, and finally, dive deep in an area of concentration.

Below is a sample course list that follows this advice, drawn entirely from business schools in [U.S. News & World Report’s top ten](https://www.usnews.com/best-graduate-schools/top-business-schools/mba-rankings?_mode=table). I cross referenced the U.S. News list with Class Central’s database to find around 90 courses from top ten schools, including the [University of Pennsylvania](https://www.class-central.com/list/university-of-pennsylvania-wharton-d1rxbgfwlo??utm_source=fcc_medium&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=mooc_mba_top_10_bschools) (#3), [MIT](https://www.class-central.com/list/massachusetts-institute-of-technology-sloan-9byq93fvb7?utm_source=fcc_medium&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=mooc_mba_top_10_bschools) (#5), [Northwestern](https://www.class-central.com/list/northwestern-university-rb7dnwfk7r?utm_source=fcc_medium&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=mooc_mba_top_10_bschools) (#6), the [University of California Berkeley](https://www.class-central.com/list/university-of-california-berkeley-haas-wd1qnyuv13?utm_source=fcc_medium&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=mooc_mba_top_10_bschools) (#7), the [University of Michigan](https://www.class-central.com/list/university-of-michigan-ross-ov1dn3cq15?utm_source=fcc_medium&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=mooc_mba_top_10_bschools) (tied for #7), [Columbia University](https://www.class-central.com/list/columbia-university-pg1d79hk5n?utm_source=fcc_medium&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=mooc_mba_top_10_bschools) (#9), and [Dartmouth](https://www.class-central.com/list/dartmouth-vmlqngh6l8?utm_source=fcc_medium&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=mooc_mba_top_10_bschools) (#10).

I used only courses from these schools not because there aren’t great MOOCs from business schools lower down in U.S. News’ ranking ([the full course catalog of the University of Illinois’s iMBA, for example](https://www.class-central.com/list/imba-courses-pknovh9x?utm_source=fcc_medium&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=mooc_mba_top_10_bschools)), but simply because A) I had to cut down the number of courses somehow, and B) I wanted to demonstrate that the content for a top-tier MBA is there for the taking.

Note: The curriculum below is a pretty solid MBA program. However, it doesn’t include every topic that might be included in an MBA. Some notable gaps: project management, micro- and macroeconomics, and business ethics. It’s also rather light on operations management.

Another Note: While many of these courses do involve fees, all of them can be audited for free, either in full or in part. If you’re new to MOOCs, you can learn more about them in Class Central’s [Beginners’ Guide to Massive Open Online Courses](https://www.class-central.com/help/moocs?utm_source=fcc_medium&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=mooc_mba_top_10_bschools).

### Foundational Business Concepts (4 courses)

The four courses in the Business Foundations Specialization from the University of Pennsylvania’s Wharton School of Business are a popular starting place for those new to the world of business. I suggest taking all four.

[**Introduction to Marketing**](https://www.class-central.com/course/coursera-introduction-to-marketing-1137?utm_source=fcc_medium&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=mooc_mba_top_10_bschools), _University of Pennsylvania via Coursera_

### General Business and Management Skills (4–6 courses)

Quantitative modeling, negotiation, project and people management, decision-making, leadership, and communication are important skills regardless of industry. I recommend taking at least one course that covers each of the aforementioned topics, for a total of between four and six courses.

[**Fundamentals of Quantitative Modeling**](https://www.class-central.com/course/coursera-fundamentals-of-quantitative-modeling-5448?utm_source=fcc_medium&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=mooc_mba_top_10_bschools), _University of Pennsylvania via Coursera_

### Concentration (8–10 courses)

I advise anyone pursuing self-directed education to develop deep knowledge and skills in an area of concentration. This is where you can reap the real value of a self-directed education. Focus on a discrete area, take courses that are rigorous, and put what you learn into practice in real world scenarios.

I’ve listed three possible MBA concentrations that could be constructed from courses offered by the top ten B-schools, excluding pre-packaged options such as the MicroMasters in Supply Chain Management from MIT.

#### Option 1 — Entrepreneurship

Entrepreneurship is the obvious choice for someone interested in starting a business. Added bonus: if you’re planning on being your own boss you won’t have to defend the value of your self-directed education in a job interview.

[**Entrepreneurship 1: Developing the Opportunity**](https://www.class-central.com/course/coursera-entrepreneurship-1-developing-the-opportunity-5467?utm_source=fcc_medium&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=mooc_mba_top_10_bschools), _University of Pennsylvania via Coursera_

#### Option 2 — Digital Strategy

With plenty of courses and many opportunities to use your skills in the real world, digital strategy makes for an excellent area of concentration. Being a relatively new field, it may also be easier to get a job in this area without a traditional degree.

#### Option 3 — Finance

Finance is a more risky area of concentration, since it can be hard to break into the industry without the right credentials. However, if you already have a foot in the door, there are plenty of finance courses at the MBA level.
