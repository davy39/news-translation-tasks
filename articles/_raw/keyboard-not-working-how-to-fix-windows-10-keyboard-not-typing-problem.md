Have you ever sat down to write some code or browse the internet, only to discover that your keyboard isn't working?

When your keyboard fails to work, it could be due to: 
- Physical damage
- Dirt
- Filter keys
- Outdated or corrupt driver
- Low battery (if you're using an external keyboard).

You can check the USB port your keyboard is inserted into and make sure it is properly connected to make it work again. You can also clean your keyboard. But those quick fixes still might not resolve the issue.

If you keep hitting your keyboard keys and nothing is showing up on your screen, you've come to the right place. Because in this guide, I'm going to show you 3 ways you can fix it.

Note that if you're having problems with your external or built-in keyboard, you'll need to turn on the onscreen keyboard to fix it with the solutions provided in this guide.

### How to turn on the onscreen keyboard
Go to settings and select Ease of Access.

## How to Fix Your Keyboard Not Working by Turning off Filter Keys

**To turn off filter keys, follow the steps below:**

**Step 1**: Click Start and search for "control panel", then hit ENTER to open up the first search result - which is always Control Panel.
