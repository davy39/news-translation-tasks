In this complete course from Fawaz Sammani you will learn the key concepts behind deep learning and how to apply the concepts to a real-life project using PyTorch.  

First, you will learn the theoretical concepts you need to know for building a chatbot, which include RNNs, LSTMS and Sequence Models with Attention.

Then you will learn about PyTorch, a very powerful and advanced deep learning Library. You will learn how to install PyTorch and how to use it.

Finally, the biggest part of the course shows how to apply the concepts to build a chatbot in PyTorch.

You can watch the tutorial on the [freeCodeCamp.org YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNuI8OWsppg) (6 hour watch).
