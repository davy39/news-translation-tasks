Many tech companies want people to solve coding challenges during interviews and many of the challenges can be solved using a greedy algorithm.

A greedy algorithm is any algorithm that follows the problem-solving heuristic of making the locally optimal choice at each stage. 

We just published a course on the freeCodeCamp.org YouTube channel that will teach you how to use greedy algorithms to solve coding challenges. 

Tanishq Chaudhary developed this course. Tanishq is a great teacher who is an expert in software algorithms.

You will learn how to solve coding interview challenges on the InterviewBit platform. Tanishq uses animations and diagrams to help you really understand how the code works.

Here are the problems you will learn to solve using greedy algorithms:

* Highest product
* Bulbs
* Disjoint intervals
* Largest permutation
* Meeting rooms
* Distribute candy
* Seats
* Assign mice to holes
* Majority element
* Gas station

Watch the full course below or on [the freeCodeCamp.org YouTube channel](https://youtu.be/bC7o8P_Ste4) (2-hour watch).
