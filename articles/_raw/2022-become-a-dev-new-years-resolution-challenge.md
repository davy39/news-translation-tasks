Every year, millions of people create New Year's Resolutions. A vast majority of these will fail. But I've created one for you that I'm optimistic you can succeed with. This is all free and you'll learn a ton.

There will be a lot of other people doing this challenge alongside you, ready to cheer you on. And you may be able to complete all of this before summer.

Here is what you will need:

1. A Mac, Windows, or Linux computer
2. A twitter account (you can create one in about 5 minutes)
3. VS Code (you can install it in about 5 minutes)
4. A Hashnode developer blog (I'll show you how to create one.)
5. At least 30 minutes per day to do the [#100DaysOfCode](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/the-crazy-history-of-the-100daysofcode-challenge-and-why-you-should-try-it-for-2018-6c89a76e298d/) challenge

I've structured this challenge to be manageable, but gradually increase in involvement. By accepting this challenge, you agree to at least give the first step a try. After that, if you're not feeling it, it's perfectly fine to abandon this New Year's Resolution challenge.

Here are the 4 steps to the challenge.

### Step #1: Max out your stats in Learn ToCode RPG (takes about 3 hours)

A lot of people aren't sure whether they want to become developers. It's a lot of work. So we created this video game that simulates the process of learning to code and applying for developer jobs.

One cool aspect of the game: you learn and apply real programming and computer science concepts.

The game currently has 6 different endings and 55 Easter eggs, and I encourage you to catch 'em all. But for the purpose of this challenge, you just need to max-out your skills.

Here's more information about [Learn to Code RPG and how to install it](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/learn-to-code-rpg/).

### Step #2: Start #100DaysOfCode (takes about 30 minutes each day for 100 days)

If you enjoyed Learn To Code RPG and are ready to dig deeper into learning coding, you can take the popular #100DaysOfCode challenge.

The rules are simple:

1. Code at least a little bit each day
2. Tweet your status (what you did) using the #100DaysOfCode hashtag
3. Encourage at least 2 other people who have also tweeted out their #100DaysOfCode status by commenting on it.

This is a popular challenge that thousands of people have done over the past 6 years. I wrote an entire [history of the #100DaysOfCode challenge](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/the-crazy-history-of-the-100daysofcode-challenge-and-why-you-should-try-it-for-2018-6c89a76e298d/) if you're curious.

While you are doing #100DaysOfCode, you can proceed to steps 3 and 4.

### Step #3: Complete the freeCodeCamp Relational Database Certification

_The freeCodeCamp Relational Database Certification running inside VS Code_

This is a new 300-hour curriculum we published in 2021 (though it may take you less than that if you have some Linux / SQL experience).

It will teach you:

* Linux
* Bash
* SQL
* Git
* ... and a lot of other command line tools

Along the way, you'll build a dozen different projects – all interactively, inside the popular VS Code editor.

Here is more information about [how to install the freeCodeCamp Relational Database Curriculum](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-run-freecodecamps-relational-databases-curriculum-using-docker-vscode-and-coderoad/) on your Mac, Windows PC, or Linux computer.

### Step #4: Publish 3 tutorials on your Hashnode blog

Hashnode is a powerful blogging tool where you can publish articles on your own personal domain, but still get some discovery within their community. They make it easy to set up a blog.

As you learn about programming and technology, I encourage you to turn around and write about it. This will not only help other people who are learning alongside you – it will help you reinforce your own learning. As the saying goes, "To teach is to learn twice."

Here's [how to set up your Hashnode developer blog](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/devblog-launch-your-developer-blog-own-domain/).

So for the final step in this challenge, you should write 3 short tutorials about programming concepts you've learned along the way.

And if you decide you want to reach an even wider audience, you can consider applying to become an author on freeCodeCamp's publication, which gets about a quarter-million readers each day. Here's [the freeCodeCamp publication style guide](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/developer-news-style-guide/) if you decide to apply.

## That's it. One video game, one certification, and 3 blog posts.

If this sounds like a reasonable challenge for your 2022 New Year's Resolution, I encourage you to go for it. Here's how you can accept the challenge: create a Twitter account if you don't have one yet and quote-retweet this tweet with the words "I'm in."

I will add you to [this Twitter List](https://twitter.com/i/lists/1476412934440067079) and you'll be able to follow it and see what everyone else is doing, and how they're progressing.

And if you make it all the way through, let me know. I will add you to the 2022 Become-a-Dev Challenge Hall of Fame below. ☺️ Good luck!
