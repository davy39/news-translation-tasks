[React Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/) is a popular and extensively employed JavaScript framework code library. It is primarily used for building attractive user interfaces and allows JavaScript developers to build native mobile apps.

One of the main reasons for React Native’s growing popularity is that it supports development for both Android as well as iOS.

So, you don’t need separate developers to write across the different mobile platforms — one developer is enough to do the job.

React Native is known for its speed and efficiency. It is best suited for app and web development. It helps a lot in reducing the cost and time of application building.

Moreover, it provides an easy and convenient environment for mobile while using the debugging tools.

There are various React Native tools which play a vital role in accelerating the speed of app development. Let’s have a look some important ones you can use in your next project.

### 1. Atom

[Atom](https://atom.io/) is a free and open-source text editor known for its easy approach and hackability. It has been developed by GitHub and was launched in February 2014. It readily supports Mac, Linux, as well as Windows.

Moreover, it allows you to pick several open source packages for adding more features and functionality. The services include an in-built package manager, cross platform editing, multiple file navigation via a single window, bespoke designs, and themes.

### 2. Nuclide

[Nuclide](https://nuclide.io/) is a free and open-source React Native tool that is developed usually as a single package on the top of Atom.

It offers hackability and the support of a large community of developers always ready to assist others. It comes with built-in support for Flow. It also includes inline errors, auto-complete and jump-to-definition features.

This React Native tool was developed and released by Facebook in 2015. It includes a plethora of services such as Remote and JavaScript development, Hack development, built-in debugging, working sets, mercurial support, task runner and so on.

### 3. Visual Studio Code

[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) was created by software giant Microsoft. It is a robust React Native source code editor that is free and open-source.

For JavaScript developers, it supports JavaScript, TypeScript, and Node.js. It also offers a good ecosystem of extensions to support other languages including C++, C#, Java, PHP and Python, and runtimes like Unity and .NET.

What gives it real strength is the combination of source code editor and developer tools such as IntelliSense code completion and debugging. The tool was released in April 2015 and written in JavaScript and TypeScript.

It supports all important platforms such as Mac, Linux, and Windows.

### 4. Expo

[Expo](https://expo.io) is an open-source toolchain for React Native developers.

It was developed by Expo and was introduced very recently in May last year. It offers a number of features such as documentation, a Slack community and community forums.

Expo provides you with a rich source of React Native components, an Expo SDK library, and native APIs for both iOS and Android platforms.

### 5. Flow

[Flow](https://flow.org/) is yet another React Native programming tool that offers static typing. Facebook released it in November 2014 and since then it has provided speedy, reliable and simplified coding.

Flow is also free due to its open-source nature. It offers services like ease of integration, real-time feedback, customizable JavaScript and type inference.

What’s interesting to note is that Flow monitors errors in the code with the help of static typing annotations.

### 6. Redux

One of the reasons why Redux is highly recommended by the developer community is offers live code editing and a time-traveling debugger. You can develop applications that run in different environments such as the front-end and native platform.

The file size is only 2KB and as such it works well with React.js and other view libraries. The developers of Redux are Dan Abramov and Andrew Clark.

### 7. ESLint

[ESLint is another open-source React Native tool](https://eslint.org/) that makes use of the JavaScript and JSX languages. It helps in the detection of the errors during the programming and exploring the existing source code.

It operates on Node.js and supports the development of cross-platform apps such as Windows, Linux and Mac. In addition, it also offers some other advantages such as transparency, customized and built-in plugins, good and clear documentation etc.

The JS Foundation launched the ESLint with an intention to allow developers to have their own linting rules.

### 8. Ignite

[The Ignite CLI](https://infinite.red/ignite) is a React toolchain comprising of plugins and boilerplate. It is free open-source tool developed by Infinite Red and released in June 2016. It provides developers access to a number of boilerplates to choose from and help support the plugins.

The boilerplates support cross-platform app development both for iOS and Android. Ignite includes services for API testing, customizable themes, components, and usage examples.

### 9. NativeBase

[NativeBase](https://nativebase.io/) is a free, open-source client-side framework tool that is indigenously used for developing cross-platform apps. It utilizes the components of React-Native and is beneficial for building cross-platform User Interface components, along with offering a native environment to create native apps.

It also offers you the advantage of using native third-party libraries. It was unveiled in 2016 by Greeky Ants.

### 10. Reactotron

[Reactotron](https://infinite.red/reactotron) is actually a desktop application that is also free and open-source. It is supported on different platforms such as Windows, Mac and Linux. It was developed by Infinite Red and made debut in 2016.

It helps to check React JS and React Native apps. In addition, it allows developers to keep a track of the status of the application, monitor the console.log messages, check API request and responses, dispatch actions and quick benchmarks.

### 11. Reduxsauce

[Reduxsauce](https://github.com/infinitered/reduxsauce) assists in making the job easier for the developers when they are working on Redux codebases. It assists in the creation of Reducers and Actions in Redux.

With this efficient tool, you need just a few lines to code, which becomes easily legible. If you want to reset the Reducer, then Reduxsauce will prove to be a worthy asset. It can also deal with the Reducer Action in a single file. Infinite Red introduced it in May 2016. It is available free of cost.

### 12. React Navigation

[React Navigation](https://reactnavigation.org/) has gained much popularity amongst the [React Native developers](https://www.mindinventory.com/hire-react-native-developer.php) because it lets them establish the routes and navigation in their native applications with the help of navigators including Tab, Drawer and Stack.

It is written in JavaScript. It helps create components for both the iOS and Android platforms, and offers Extensible Platforms and bespoke JavaScript.

### 13. React Native Tools

### 16. Adobe XD

Adobe XD is a prototype designing tool that helps in developing the UI and UX designs for the websites or mobile apps at a much quicker pace. It has some instinctive tools that would improve the performance of the designers while working on the project.

The features such as Repeat Grid and flexible artboards save a lot of time for the developers. The presence of low fidelity wireframes helps to comprehensively develop an interactive prototype.

What’s more exciting to note is that you have the option of shifting from static layouts to dynamic prototypes with just a single click and even make suitable changes in your design. It is not free, and you need to pay $9.99 per month for availing the initial plan. It is developed by Adobe Systems and released in October 2017.

### Conclusion

React Native is one of today’s most preferred programming tools, thanks to the wonderful tools available for mobile and web developers.

All these tools are easy to use and maintain. They help the entire process of development — right from designing the prototype, developing the app, and finally the app testing.

Moreover, most of these tools support cross-platform app development and can be used for both Android and iOS platforms.
