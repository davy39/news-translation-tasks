2019 has been a big year for the global freeCodeCamp community.

* More people are answering questions on the forum.
* Our publication has several new, rising authors.
* And our community has made hundreds of improvements to our curriculum and learning platform.

In 2019, people used freeCodeCamp for a grand total of more than 1.1 billion minutes. That's 2,000 years, or an average of 2,000 people using freeCodeCamp at any given moment.

freeCodeCamp is a tiny donor supported nonprofit with only 7 full-time staff and a budget of only US $373,119.

And yet we are able to accomplish the mission of a 100-person nonprofit with a multi-million dollar budget.

How are we able to do this?

Because we have a global community of volunteers.

I have met with all of these people over the years, and I can say without hesitation: these contributors are among the most kind, thoughtful people I've ever met.

And in the final week of 2019, I want to recognize their incredible efforts and all that they've accomplished this year.

Without further ado, here are 2019's top contributors who make possible freeCodeCamp's ambitious mission of helping people around the world learn to code for free.

Some quick notes: This list focuses on people who are contributing through:

* the open source codebase and curriculum
* the community publication
* the community forum
* the community YouTube channel

We're shipping each of these top contributors a special version of our [limited edition freeCodeCamp backpacks](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/2019-freecodecamp-backpack/).

Some people have already started receiving theirs.

Note that we will recognize contributors to our new [Chapter project](https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/chapter) once it launches - along with the many people who lead freeCodeCamp chapters around the world.

Note that most of the people recognized here on this year's list weren't Top Contributors in 2018.

If you contributed to freeCodeCamp in 2019 but didn't make the list, keep it up. There's a good chance you can make our list for 2020.

Here's the full list in reverse alphabetical order by first name. I list some contributors by their desired pseudonyms out of respect for their privacy.

"I have learned so much more about the ins and outs of JavaScript by trying to explain complex concepts in plain language to campers. It is a win for the camper and a win for me. The better I get at explaining the concepts, the better I can identify when to implement them in my own projects. In 2020, I'm looking forward to implementing a completely autonomous bot that will help expedite the review process of pull requests in the freeCodeCamp repo."

[@1_infinite_loop](https://twitter.com/1_infinite_loop)  
"When I was learning to code, I continually struggled with the lack of free and quality resources available out there. When I had doubts, asking questions on StackOverflow meant spending more time on phrasing and re-phrasing the question itself (due to fear of downvotes), rather than focusing on the problem at hand. When contributing to open source, GitHub project maintainers would often ignore my questions. Having gone through all of this, I know how much it means when someone can help you with your questions, or guide you on your journey, as you get your feet wet with coding. That is why I try to help out as many people as I can."

"Code can bring you freedom, flexibility, time to spend with your family, to travel, and financials to afford the necessities. By helping others learn to code and become better programmers, I feel fulfilled and happy in a way that a raise on my salary would never be able to do.

"I am learning to code by myself using fCC, in the same way as people all over the world. This could be a very isolating experience, but helping others and asking for help on the forum gives us a supportive community to be a part of."

"So many people become limited by feeling that they "can't" do something. I love working with students who are new or struggling, when they are the most vulnerable to this false sense of failure."

"I started my coding journey with fCC. The community helped me with my silly questions, and made me reach my goal to get a job as a software engineer. Now, I'm doing my part to help fellow campers reach their goals."

## That's all. Congratulations to each of these contributors.

Again, most of the people recognized here weren't Top Contributors in 2018. 

If you contributed in 2019 and didn't make the list, keep it up. We would love to have you in the fCC 100 for 2020.

Happy coding.
