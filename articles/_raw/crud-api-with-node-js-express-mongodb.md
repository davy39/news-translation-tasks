A key part of most backend development projects is CRUD. Simply put, **CRUD** stands for **Create, Read, Update, Delete**. These fundamental operations form the basis of how data is handled in many applications, making understanding them crucial for backend development.

We just posted a course on the freeCodeCamp.org YouTube channel that will throw you into the world of **backend development** by guiding you through building a **CRUD API** from scratch. You will use Node.js, Express, and MongoDB. The course is led by popular instructor and experienced developer Haris Iftikhar.

Now, what about the technologies? This course will equip you with three powerful tools:

* **Node.js:** A JavaScript runtime environment that allows you to run JavaScript code outside of the browser, perfect for building server-side applications.
* **Express.js:** A popular web framework built on top of Node.js, providing structure and tools to simplify web development.
* **MongoDB:** A NoSQL database, meaning it stores data in a flexible and document-oriented manner, ideal for modern applications.

Together, these technologies form the backbone of the **MERN Stack**, a widely used combination for building full-stack web applications. In this course, you'll be focusing on the MEN part (minus the React front-end), laying a solid foundation for your backend development journey.

The course is structured into bite-sized sections, taking you through each step of building your CRUD API:

* **Setting the Stage:** Understand the project outline and get familiar with the tools you'll be using.
* **Project Essentials:** Dive into `package.json`, the Express framework, and learn how to run your server efficiently.
* **Data Management:** Explore API testing tools, utilize Git Bash for version control, and set up your MongoDB database.
* **Building the API:** Craft your data model, create API endpoints for creating, reading, updating, and deleting data.
* **Form Handling:** Understand Form URL Encoded data and how to handle it in your API.
* **Structuring your Code:** Organize your code with routes and controllers, keeping things clean and maintainable.
* **Testing and Deployment:** Learn how to thoroughly test your API and push your code to GitHub for version control and collaboration.

By the end of this course, you'll have built a functional CRUD API using Node, Express, and MongoDB, gaining valuable hands-on experience in backend development. This knowledge will pave the way for you to explore more complex concepts and build even more sophisticated applications in the future.
