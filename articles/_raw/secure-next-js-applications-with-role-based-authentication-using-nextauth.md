If you create Next.js apps, chanced are you are going to have to include user authentication at some point. 

We just posted a course on the freeCodeCamp.org YouTube channel that teaches how to implement authentication in Next.js 13.5 with the powerful library, NextAuth – which will soon be known as AuthJS.

Jacob Lower from Clarity Coders created this course. He is an experienced developer and teacher.

Authenticating users is an essential aspect of modern web applications, and this comprehensive video tutorial is created to equip you with the knowledge to do just that. You'll learn about role-based authentication, an approach that not only enhances security but also gives you fine-grained control over what different users can see and do on your site.

The course kicks off with the basics of NextAuth, walking you through the environment setup and project creation. Then you will learn how to use NextAuth for server-rendered and client-rendered pages, giving you a holistic understanding of authentication processes.

The tutorial takes a practical approach by incorporating out-of-the-box OAuth providers such as Google and GitHub, showing you how to integrate these widely used services into your application seamlessly. But for those who like to customize, the course has got you covered too. It explores how to craft your custom authentication provider using MongoDB, ensuring you know how to tailor authentication to your specific requirements.

This video is not just about the 'how-to' but also about the 'how-it-works.' From setting up API routes and options to protecting pages on both the server and client side, the course is structured to provide you with hands-on experience. You'll even learn about middleware and how to manage login and logout functionalities effectively.

Here are the sections in this course:

* Introduction
* Environment Setup / Extension Review
* Project Creation
* Install NextAuth (Auth.js) / Create Project Structure
