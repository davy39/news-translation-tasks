Are you looking to improve your frontend web development skills with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, TypeScript, and React? If so, we have the perfect video course for you!

We just published a 10-hour project-based, frontend web development course on the freeCodeCamp.org YouTube channel.

Zach Gollwitzer published this course. Zach is a full stack developer and his Frontend Developer Bootcamp course we published a few months ago has over 1,000,000 views. This new course is a sequel to that previous course. However, you can jump straight to this course if you already have a basic understanding of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

This video course is divided into four sections, with each section building on the previous one. In Section 1, you will learn how to build a Tic Tac Toe game with Vanilla HTML/CSS/JS. This will be the foundation for the rest of the course.

In this first section, you will learn how to set up your project and the necessary VSCode extensions. Then, you will build the UI with HTML and CSS and add JavaScript interactivity to the project.

In Section 2, you will refactor the Tic Tac Toe game to use the Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern. You will explore why this pattern is helpful and how it can improve the structure of your code.

Section 3 will introduce you to TypeScript and teach you how to set it up from scratch. You will learn the benefits of using TypeScript and how it can improve the reliability and maintainability of your code.

Finally, in Section 4, you will refactor the Tic Tac Toe game to use React and TypeScript. You will learn how to set up a React app from scratch and explore why React is useful and what problems it solves over a Vanilla approach. You will also learn how to initialize TypeScript in a React app from scratch and refactor your Vanilla app to a React app.

This video course is perfect for anyone looking to improve their frontend web development skills, from beginners to intermediate developers.

Watch the full course on [the freeCodeCamp.org YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsnQ5uepIaE) (10-hour watch).
