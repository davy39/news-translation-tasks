If you want to get into the growing field of cyber security and ethical hacking, you are going to need to understand how to use Linux.

We just released a free course on the freeCodeCamp.org YouTube channel that will teach you all the common Linux skills used in cyber-security and ethical hacking.

HackerSploit created this course. He runs one of the most popular cyber-security channels on YouTube. In this course, he uses the Pareto principle (The 20:80 Rule) to teach the 20% you need to know to be efficient with Linux.
