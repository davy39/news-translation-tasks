On this week's episode of the podcast, I interview Jabril. He's an indie game developer who's building a turn-based fighting game called Ultrabouters.

Jabril has developed tons of other games as well. He runs the popular Jabrils gamedev focused-YouTube. He's also published a 5-hour introduction to programming course on freeCodeCamp.

We talk about:

* How Jabril got into gamedev as a kid when he got a copy of GameMaker
* Jabril's career working at a comedy club and a radio station
* The anime that Jabril's been working on for years
* Jabril's advice to gamedevs who want to make a career out of building video games

Can you guess what bass line I'm playing on my bass during the intro? It's a 2009 song that became popular in the 2010's by being associated with a meme.
