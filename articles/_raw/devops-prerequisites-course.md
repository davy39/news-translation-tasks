DevOps combines software **dev**elopment and IT **op**eration**s** with the goal of shortening the systems development life cycle and providing continuous delivery of software. We've released a 3-hour beginner's course on the freeCodeCamp.org YouTube channel to help you get started in the world of DevOps. 

The course from KodeKloud covers the basic prerequisite knowledge needed as you learn about DevOps. After this course, you will be ready to jump into more advanced DevOps courses. 

In the first section you will learn the basics of Linux, including common commands and how to use the VI editor. Next, you will learn how to install software and dependencies in Linux, and how to configure services.

After learning about Linux, you will learn how to set up a personal lab environment using VirtualBox and Vagrant. You will also learn how to troubleshoot and maintain the environment.

After this you will learn more about networking. You will learn about configuring interfaces and IP addresses, setting up VMs to connect to the internet, configuring routing and DNS, and more.

Finally you will learn about YAML and JSON, and how they are commonly used in DevOps tools.

Along with the instruction, there are links to many hands-on labs that will allow you to practice what you learn in this course.

You can watch the course below or on [the freeCodeCamp.org YouTube channel](https://youtu.be/Wvf0mBNGjXY) (3 hour watch).
