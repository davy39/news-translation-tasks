[The Japanese freeCodeCamp curriculum](https://www.freecodecamp.org/japanese/learn) is now live.

In Japan, I have seen many comments, tweets, and blog posts saying "freeCodeCamp looks awesome, but unfortunately, I can't use it because I can't read English."

Currently, most information and learning resources related to programming are in English. But we want freeCodeCamp to be a place where everyone can learn to code in their native language.

I hope the Japanese freeCodeCamp curriculum will be a new option for Japanese speakers who wish to learn to code.

## Japanese translation contributors/supporters

The translation effort at freeCodeCamp is supported by many contributors.

Also, the Japanese translation of the entire curriculum, in particular, was made possible thanks to the support of Mr. Kimio Momose and Mr. Thomas Telandro of the nonprofit organization Unbiased Learning and the translation company TMJ Japan Ltd.

I appreciate all the help from everyone who contributed to this translation effort.

Below is a list of contributors who have participated in the Japanese translation so far.

## Frequently Asked Questions 

Below are answers to frequently asked questions about the Japanese curriculum.

### I'm halfway through the English curriculum. What should I do?

Your progress and certificates are available in all languages. You don't have to go over it in Japanese again. You can just switch to the Japanese curriculum (making sure you're signed in) and continue with it.

You can switch languages at any time from the menu button at the top right corner of the [learning platform](https://www.freecodecamp.org/japanese/learn).

Also, certificates you already earned in the past can be displayed in Japanese if you would like.

### I need help with the curriculum. Where should I ask questions?

The [freeCodeCamp forum](https://forum.freecodecamp.org/) is the best place to ask questions about the freeCodeCamp curriculum and projects.

In addition, there is now [Japanese sub-forum](https://forum.freecodecamp.org/c/japanese/552) too so you can post questions there. Asking questions in Japanese will help other Japanese campers who face the same problem in the future. 

Of course, you can also help the Japanese community grow even more by answering questions from other campers.

### I found a translation error or I want to propose improvements to a translation.

We appreciate it if you could let us know in our [contributor chat](https://discord.gg/PRyKn3Vbay) or in the comments on Crowdin, our translation platform.

See [this forum post](https://forum.freecodecamp.org/t/freecodecamp/484083) for more details.

It's OK even if you are not 100% sure about your suggestion. Please reach out to us, and we can discuss how we can improve it together.

### I want to participate in the translation effort.

We welcome new contributors! Feel free to join the [contributor chat](https://discord.gg/PRyKn3Vbay) and say "Hi".

freeCodeCamp is an open source project, and we are constantly improving and updating our curriculum. New courses will be added from time to time.

Because of this, there will always be more translation work to do each time we add or change something, so we would appreciate your continued contributions.

You can also contribute to the source code on GitHub.

### I can't participate in translation, but I want to help freeCodeCamp and the Japanese community.

There will be more and more things we need help with as the Japanese community grows.

Please reach out to me in the [contributors chat](https://discord.gg/PRyKn3Vbay). Let's talk about how we can help the Japanese freeCodeCamp community together.
