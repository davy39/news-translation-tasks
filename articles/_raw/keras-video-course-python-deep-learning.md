Keras is a neural network API written in Python and integrated with TensorFlow. You can learn how to use Keras in a new [video course on the freeCodeCamp.org YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qFJeN9V1ZsI).

In this course from [deeplizard](https://deeplizard.com), you will learn how to prepare and process data for artificial neural networks, build and train  artificial neural networks from scratch, build and train convolutional neural networks (CNNs), implement fine-tuning and transfer learning, and more.

Each section of the course focuses on a specific concept, and shows how the full implementation is done in code using Keras and Python.

You will learn to build some networks from scratch. Others will be pre-trained state-of-the-art models that you'll get to fine-tune to the data. Then you'll learn how to deploy models using both front-end and back-end deployment techniques.

Here's the full course syllabus:

### Part 1: Artificial Neural Network Basics

Section 1: Intro to Keras and neural networks

* Processing data
* Building and training neural networks
* Validation and inference
* Saving and loading models

Section 2: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)

* Image processing
* Building and training CNNs
* Using CNNs for inference

Section 3: Fine-tuning and transfer learning

* Intro to fine-tuning and VGG16 model
* Implement fine-tuning on VGG16 model
* Using fine-tuned models for inference
* Intro to MobileNet
* Fine-tuning MobileNet on subset of data

Section 4: Additional topics

* Data augmentation
* Keras' image labeling implementation
* Achieving reproducible results
* Learnable parameters

### Part 2: Neural network model deployment

Section 1: Deployment with Flask

* Introduction to Flask and web services
* Build a simple Flask app and web app
* Send and receive data with Flask
* Host neural network with Flask
* Build neural network web app to interact with Flask service
* Integrating data visualization with D3, DC, Crossfilter
* Alternative ways to access neural network from Powershell and Curl
* Information privacy and data protection

Section 2: Deployment with TensorFlow.js

* Introduction to client-side neural networks
* Convert Keras model to TFJS model
* Set up Node.js and Express
* Build UI for neural network web app
* Host a neural network with TFJS
* Explore tensor operations through image processing
* Examine tensor operations with debugger
* Broadcasting tensors
* Efficiency of hosting MobileNet in the browser
