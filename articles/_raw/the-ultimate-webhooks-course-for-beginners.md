Understanding webhooks will open up a world of possibilities for your projects and applications. Webhooks allow different web applications and services to communicate with each other.

We've released a webhooks course on the freeCodeCamp YouTube channel that will take you from being a complete beginner to being able to use webhooks in your own apps.

We've released a lot of courses on the freeCodeCamp.org YouTube channel and I can honestly say that this is one of the most well-made courses on the channel.

Craig Dennis teaches this course. He is a Developer Educator at Twilio and has created many popular courses.

You will learn all about webhooks through expert instruction, fun animations, and hands-on practice. You will learn how to use webhooks with no code and with low code. Craig prepared extensive notes for you to use while going through this course.
