If your goal is to collect data from websites automatically, web scraping may be exactly what you need. In this course, you will learn all the basics with exercises and practical projects.

We published a course on the [freeCodeCamp.org Spanish YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/freecodecampespanol) that will teach you how to use web scraping to collect data from websites automatically with Python and Beautiful Soup.

If you have Spanish-speaking friends, you are welcome to share the **[Spanish version of this article](https://www.freecodecamp.org/espanol/news/aprende-web-scraping-con-python-y-beautiful-soup-en-espanol-curso-desde-cero/)** with them.

The course was created by [Gustavo Juantorena](https://twitter.com/GJuantorena). He is a Biologist specializing in Neuroscience and he is pursuing a PhD in Computer Science at the Applied Artificial Intelligence Laboratory at the University of Buenos Aires, Argentina. 

Gustavo has extensive experience teaching Python, data science, and web scraping. In this course, he will show you step by step how you can apply these techniques in your projects.

The course topics include:

* Introduction to Application Programming Interfaces (APIs)
* Basic concepts of the Web
* The DOM (Document Object Model)
* Web scraping with Python
* The web scraping workflow
* How to use APIs
* How to use Beautiful Soup
* The `find()` and `find_all()` methods
* How to find attributes in HTML
* How to select elements by their attributes
* How to automatically download images
* The "iframe" and "table" tags
* How to extract product data
* URL-dependent changes
* How to search for data on a page
* How to move through the DOM tree
* Exception handling
* Data storage

The course has a practical approach. 

You will start by getting data from the Wikipedia API and an API that returns sunrise and sunset times. Then you will apply your web scraping knowledge to a real website called [ScrapePark.org](https://scrapepark.org/spanish/). 

You will work with one of the most important and widely used tools in the data science world: Jupyter Notebooks. 

You will write and run your Python code in Jupyter Notebooks in Google Colaboratory.

## ScrapePark Project

During the course, you will also apply your knowledge to a practical project created in collaboration with freeCodeCamp.org: [ScrapePark.org](https://scrapepark.org/spanish/).

_scrapepark.org/spanish (Spanish version)._

**ScrapePark.org** is a website that simulates an online skateboard store. It was created specifically for this course and is managed by freeCodeCamp.org so that you can safely practice your web scraping skills.

Gustavo will show you how to apply web scraping to this website to collect data about its products automatically.

Sounds great, right? 😁

By the end of the course, you will have the knowledge that you need to apply web scraping techniques to real-world situations and projects.

If you are interested in data science, marketing, or programming, this course will teach you the skills you need to use the full potential of web data.

## **Web Scraping Course on YouTube**

Great! Now that you know more about web scraping, we invite you to take Gustavo's course on the [freeCodeCamp.org YouTube channel in Spanish](https://www.youtube.com/freecodecampespanol).
