Stable diffusion makes it simple for people to create AI art with just text inputs. I just released a video course about Stable Diffusion on the freeCodeCamp.org YouTube channel. This article will introduce you to the course and give important setup and reading links for the course.

This course focuses on teaching you how to use stable diffusion as a tool instead of going into the technical details. To understand some big terms like VAEs or embeddings, you will need to have some machine learning background and do some research on your own.

You will need to have access to a local GPU to try out the course material. Cloud access to GPU (with the exception of Google Colab) would work too. It's unfortunate, but Google Colab has banned Stable Diffusion code from running in their notebooks.

In this tutorial, we will cover the following topics:

1. How to use Stable Diffusion
    
2. How to train your own model for a specific character or art style (LoRA models)
    
3. How to use Control Net, a popular Stable Diffusion plugin
    
4. How to use Stable Diffusion's API Endpoint
    

Check out the course video below on the freeCodeCamp.org YouTube channel. Under the video are additional resources.
