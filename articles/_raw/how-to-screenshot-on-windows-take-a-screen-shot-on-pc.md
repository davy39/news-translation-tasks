Just like you can take screenshots on your phone, you can also do the same on your Windows computer.

Whether you want to take a screenshot of a particular part of your screen or you want to take a screenshot of the whole screen, there are tools and keyboard combinations you can use to do it.

In this article, I will show 4 ways to take screenshots on a Windows PC. 

I will also show you a trick I’ve been using to take screenshots with Microsoft Word for a long time until I discovered better ways to do it.

## How to Take Screenshots with Windows and PrintScreen (`PrtScn`) Keys 

You can take a screenshot of your entire screen by holding `WIN` (Windows logo key) and pressing the Print screen key (`PrtScn`).

Your screen will dim slightly – indicating that you just took a screenshot.

You can find the screenshots inside a screenshots subfolder in your pictures folder (`C:\Users\user\Pictures\Screenshots`).

Here’s mine:

## How to Take Screenshots with the Snipping Tool 

The snipping tool is a Microsoft utility app for taking screenshots. It’s been available since Windows 7.

To take screenshots with the snipping tool, press hold `WIN` (Windows logo key) and `SHIFT`, then press `S`.

Your screen will then go dim – giving you access to a screen where you can select the type of screenshot you want to take.

After taking the screenshot, a notification will pop up. 
 
Click the notification box to get access to the snipping tool UI.

## How to Take Screenshots with the Microsoft Ergonomic Keyboard

The Microsoft ergonomic keyboard has a key with which you can get access to the Microsoft snipping tool. 

With the key, you don’t need to press WIN + SHIFT + S like the previous method for taking screenshots.

Press the key, take your screenshot, edit the screenshot if you want to, then save it.

## How to Take Screenshots with the Game Bar

The Microsoft Game Bar is another utility for recording screens and taking screenshots.

To get access to the Game Bar, press `WIN` (Windows logo key) + `G`.

Click on screenshot.

You will see the screenshot under the Captures subfolder in your videos folder (`C:\Users\user\Videos\Captures`).

## How to Take Screenshots with the PrintScreen (`PrtScn`) Key and MS Word (The trick)

Taking a screenshot with the print screen key saves the screenshot in your clipboard. What if you want to save the screenshot on your computer?

To do this, press the `PrtScn` key and open Microsoft Word.

Press `CTRL` + `V` to paste the screenshot.

Right-click the screenshot and click “Save as picture”.
