By David Venturi

A year ago, I dropped out of one of the best computer science programs in Canada. I started creating my own [data science master’s program](https://medium.com/@davidventuri/i-dropped-out-of-school-to-create-my-own-data-science-master-s-here-s-my-curriculum-1b400dcee412#.5fwwphdqd) using online resources. I realized that I could learn everything I needed through edX, Coursera, and Udacity instead. And I could learn it faster, more efficiently, and for a fraction of the cost.

I’m almost finished now. I’ve taken many data science-related courses and audited portions of many more. I know the options out there, and what skills are needed for learners preparing for a data analyst or data scientist role. **A few months ago, I started creating a review-driven guide that recommends the best courses for each subject within data science.**

For the first guide in the series, I recommended a few [coding classes](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/if-you-want-to-learn-data-science-start-with-one-of-these-programming-classes-fb694ffe780c/#.42hhzxopw) for the beginner data scientist. Then it was [statistics and probability classes](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/if-you-want-to-learn-data-science-take-a-few-of-these-statistics-classes-9bbabab098b9/#.p7pac546r).

### Now onto introductions to data science.

_(Don’t worry if you’re unsure of what an intro to data science course entails. I’ll explain shortly.)_

For this guide, I spent 10+ hours trying to identify every online intro to data science course offered as of January 2017, extracting key bits of information from their syllabi and reviews, and compiling their ratings. For this task, I turned to none other than the open source Class Central community and its database of thousands of course ratings and reviews.

![Image](https://cdn-media-1.freecodecamp.org/images/1*PEbx8gPbRHuABqdNw0_dDw.png)
_Class Central’s [homepage](https://www.class-central.com/" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title=")._

Since 2011, [Class Central](https://www.class-central.com/) founder [Dhawal Shah](https://www.class-central.com/@dhawal) has kept a closer eye on online courses than arguably anyone else in the world. Dhawal personally helped me assemble this list of resources.

### How we picked courses to consider

Each course must fit three criteria:

1. **It must teach the data science process.** More on that soon.
2. **It must be on-demand or offered every few months.**
3. **It must be an interactive online course, so no books or read-only tutorials**. Though these are viable ways to learn, this guide focuses on courses.

We believe we covered every notable course that fits the above criteria. Since there are seemingly hundreds of courses on [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/), we chose to consider the most-reviewed and highest-rated ones only. There’s always a chance that we missed something, though. So please let us know in the comments section if we left a good course out.

### How we evaluated courses

We compiled average rating and number of reviews from Class Central and other review sites to calculate a weighted average rating for each course. We read text reviews and used this feedback to supplement the numerical ratings.

We made subjective syllabus judgment calls based on two factors:

1. **Coverage of the data science process.** Does the course brush over or skip certain subjects? Does it cover certain subjects in too much detail? See the next section for what this process entails.

2. **Usage of common data science tools.** Is the course taught using popular programming languages like Python and/or R? These aren’t necessary, but helpful in most cases so slight preference is given to these courses.

![Image](https://cdn-media-1.freecodecamp.org/images/1*4NoJKhtSpxGrqFOjl89MeQ.png)
_Python and R are the two most popular programming languages used in data science._

### What is the data science process?

_What is data science? What does a data scientist do?_ These are the types of fundamental questions that an intro to data science course should answer. The following infographic from Harvard professors Joe Blitzstein and Hanspeter Pfister outlines a typical **data science process**, which will help us answer these questions.

_Visualization from [Opera Solutions](http://blog.operasolutions.com/bid/384900/what-is-data-science" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title=")._

Our goal with this introduction to data science course is to become familiar with the data science process. We don’t want too in-depth coverage of specific aspects of the process, hence the “intro to” portion of the title.

For each aspect, the ideal course explains key concepts within the framework of the process, introduces common tools, and provides a few examples (preferably hands-on).

We’re only looking for an introduction. This guide therefore won’t include full specializations or programs like Johns Hopkins University’s [Data Science Specialization](http://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/click?id=SAyYsTvLiGQ&subid=&offerid=479491.1&type=10&tmpid=18061&u1=cc-medium-career-guide-intro-to-data-science &RD_PARM1=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.coursera.org%2Fspecializations%2Fjhu-data-science%2F) on Coursera or Udacity’s [Data Analyst Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/data-analyst-nanodegree--nd002?utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=api). These compilations of courses elude the purpose of this series: to find the best **individual** courses for each subject to comprise a data science education. The final three guides in this series of articles will cover each aspect of the data science process in detail.

### Basic coding, stats, and probability experience required

Several courses listed below require basic programming, statistics, and probability experience. This requirement is understandable given that the new content is reasonably advanced, and that these subjects often have several courses dedicated to them.

This experience can be acquired through our recommendations in the first two articles ([programming](https://medium.freecodecamp.com/if-you-want-to-learn-data-science-start-with-one-of-these-programming-classes-fb694ffe780c#.ld31z08y5), [statistics](https://medium.freecodecamp.com/if-you-want-to-learn-data-science-take-a-few-of-these-statistics-classes-9bbabab098b9)) in this Data Science Career Guide.

### Our pick for the best intro to data science course is…

* [Data Science A-Z™: Real-Life Data Science Exercises Included](http://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/click?id=SAyYsTvLiGQ&offerid=507388.9685&type=3&subid=0&u1=cc-medium-career-guide-intro-to-data-science) (Kirill Eremenko/Udemy)

Kirill Eremenko’s [Data Science A-Z™](http://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/click?id=SAyYsTvLiGQ&subid=&offerid=323058.1&type=10&tmpid=14538&RD_PARM1=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.udemy.com%2Fdatascience%2F%26u1%3Dcc-medium-career-guide-intro-to-data-science) on Udemy is the clear winner in terms of breadth and depth of coverage of the data science process of the 20+ courses that qualified. It has a 4.5-star weighted average rating over 3,071 reviews, which places it among the highest rated and most reviewed courses of the ones considered.

It outlines the full process and provides real-life examples. At 21 hours of content, it is a good length. Reviewers love the instructor’s delivery and the organization of the content. The price varies depending on Udemy discounts, which are frequent, so you may be able to purchase access for as little as $10.

Though it doesn’t check our “usage of common data science tools” box**,** the non-Python/R tool choices (gretl, Tableau, Excel) are used effectively in context. Eremenko mentions the following when explaining the gretl choice (gretl is a statistical software package), though it applies to all of the tools he uses (emphasis mine):

> In gretl, we will be able to do the same modeling just like in R and Python but we won’t have to code. That’s the big deal here. Some of you may already know R very well, but some may not know it at all. My goal is to show you how to build a robust model and **give you a framework that you can apply in any tool you choose**. gretl will help us avoid getting bogged down in our coding.

One prominent reviewer noted the following:

> Kirill is the best teacher I’ve found online. He uses real life examples and explains common problems so that you get a deeper understanding of the coursework. He also provides a lot of insight as to what it means to be a data scientist from working with insufficient data all the way to presenting your work to C-class management. I highly recommend this course for beginner students to intermediate data analysts!

### A great Python-focused introduction

* [Intro to Data Analysis](https://www.class-central.com/mooc/4937/udacity-intro-to-data-analysis) (Udacity)

Udacity’s [Intro to Data Analysis](https://www.class-central.com/mooc/4937/udacity-intro-to-data-analysis) is a relatively new offering that is part of Udacity’s popular [Data Analyst Nanodegree](https://medium.com/@davidventuri/review-udacity-data-analyst-nanodegree-1e16ae2b6d12#.8uvi6hlpv). It covers the data science process clearly and cohesively using Python, though it lacks a bit in the modeling aspect. The estimated timeline is 36 hours (six hours per week over six weeks), though it is shorter in my experience. It has a 5-star weighted average rating over two reviews. It is free.

The videos are well-produced and the instructor (Caroline Buckey) is clear and personable. Lots of programming quizzes enforce the concepts learned in the videos. Students will leave the course confident in their new and/or improved NumPy and Pandas skills (these are popular Python libraries). The final project — which is graded and reviewed in the Nanodegree but not in the free individual course — can be a nice add to a portfolio.

### An impressive offering with no review data

* [Data Science Fundamentals](https://bigdatauniversity.com/learn/data-science/) (Big Data University)

Data Science Fundamentals is a four-course series provided by IBM’s Big Data University. It includes courses titled [Data Science 101](https://bigdatauniversity.com/courses/data-science-101/), [Data Science Methodology](https://bigdatauniversity.com/courses/data-science-methodology-2/), [Data Science Hands-on with Open Source Tools](https://bigdatauniversity.com/courses/data-science-hands-open-source-tools/), and [R 101](https://bigdatauniversity.com/courses/r-101/).

It covers the full data science process and introduces Python, R, and several other open-source tools. The courses have tremendous production value. 13–18 hours of effort is estimated, depending on if you take the “R 101” course at the end, which isn’t necessary for the purpose of this guide. Unfortunately, it has no review data on the major review sites that we used for this analysis, so we can’t recommend it over the above two options yet. It is free.

* [CS109 Data Science](http://cs109.github.io/2015/) (Harvard University): Full process coverage in great depth (probably too in depth for the purpose of this series). A full 12-week undergraduate course. Course navigation is difficult since the course is not designed for online consumption. Actual Harvard lectures are filmed. The above data science process infographic originates from this course. Uses Python. No review data. Free.

* [Introduction to Data Analytics for Business](http://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/click?id=SAyYsTvLiGQ&subid=&offerid=451430.1&type=10&tmpid=18061&u1=cc-medium-career-guide-intro-to-data-science&RD_PARM1=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.coursera.org%2Flearn%2Fdata-analytics-business) (University of Colorado Boulder/Coursera): Partial process coverage (lacks modeling and visualization aspects) with a focus on business. The data science process is disguised as the “Information-Action Value chain” in their lectures. Four weeks in length. Describes several tools, though only covers SQL in any depth. No review data. Free and paid options available.
* [Introduction to Data Science](https://www.lynda.com/Big-Data-tutorials/Introduction-Data-Science/420305-2.html) (Lynda): Full process coverage, though limited depth of coverage. Quite short (three hours of content). Introduces both R and Python. No review data. Cost depends on Lynda subscription.

### Wrapping it Up

This is the third of a six-piece series that covers the best online courses for launching yourself into the data science field. We covered programming in the [first article](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/if-you-want-to-learn-data-science-start-with-one-of-these-programming-classes-fb694ffe780c/#.fhrn45v3c) and statistics and probability in the [second article](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/if-you-want-to-learn-data-science-take-a-few-of-these-statistics-classes-9bbabab098b9/#.p7pac546r). The remainder of the series will cover other data science core competencies: data visualization and machine learning.
