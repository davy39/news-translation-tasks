Creating an MMO (Massively Multiplayer Online) game may seem like a daunting task, but with the right tools and guidance, you can bring your game idea to life. Whether you're an aspiring game developer or just curious about how online multiplayer games work, this Unity tutorial will provide a step-by-step guide to building your own simple MMO. You'll learn how to develop a scalable online game using Unity, C#, and SpacetimeDB, a powerful database designed for real-time multiplayer applications.

We just published a course on the [freeCodeCamp.org](http://freeCodeCamp.org) YouTube channel that will teach you how to create an MMO game from scratch using Unity and SpacetimeDB. I created the course myself! This beginner-friendly course walks you through every step of the development process. The game you'll create is a space-themed version of [*agar.io*](http://agar.io), where players control an entity that grows larger as it collects smaller objects while competing with others in real time. By the end of the course, you'll have a fully functional MMO game that can support hundreds of players simultaneously.

Throughout the course, you'll gain hands-on experience with:

* **Unity Game Development** – Learn how to build and design your game using the Unity engine.
    
* **C# Programming** – Write scripts to control player movement, interactions, and game mechanics.
    
* **SpacetimeDB** – Implement a real-time multiplayer database to manage player data efficiently.
    
* **Server and Client Architecture** – Set up the game’s backend and handle communication between players.
    
* **Multiplayer Game Mechanics** – Create a competitive, interactive game world where players can grow, compete, and strategize.
    

This course is perfect for beginners, though some prior experience with Unity or C# can be helpful. However, even if you're completely new, I will break everything down step by step, to make sure anyone can follow along and build their own MMO.

If you've ever wanted to create your own online game, this course is a great starting point. Check it out now on the [freeCodeCamp.org YouTube channel](https://youtu.be/msVwc0IwYl0).
