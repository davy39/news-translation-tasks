A GIF (Graphics Interchange Format) is a small animated image that you can share with your friends and family. And there are many ways to create them without downloading any software.

In this article, I will show you how to use the [Make a Gif](https://makeagif.com/)  site, where you can create GIFs with just a few short steps.

[Make a Gif](https://makeagif.com/) is a site where you can use your own images and videos to make your own GIFs. You can create an account with an email and password or your Facebook and Twitter account.

I am going to choose the first option which is to create a GIF from personal images.

You will then be taken to an editor.

Click on the Upload Images button or Drag and Drop images to Upload from your computer. You need to have at least two images to create a GIF.

In the editor, you can choose to resize your image, add captions, stickers and control the speed of the animation.
