IPTV stands for Internet Protocol Television. It's a service you can use to watch your favorite TV shows without needing to sign up for cable. But how does it work exactly?

In this article, I will break down the different types of IPTV services including free and paid services. 

## What is IPTV? 

IPTV services provide you access to multiple TV channels using your internet connection. Some of the services are free while others will charge a monthly subscription fee. 

IPTV services are typically cheaper than high priced cable subscriptions. These services also allow you to watch videos on your own schedule as opposed to the prearranged times from the cable provider.

A lot of the paid IPTV services will offer live TV channels which include live sporting events. IPTV services will also offer a collection of movies. 

## Types of IPTV services

Here are some popular types of IPTV services.

### Video on Demand (VOD)

The [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store?hl=en_US&gl=US) and [Apple iTunes](https://www.apple.com/itunes/) are examples of TV on Demand IPTV services. 

If you plan on watching multiple TV shows and movies, then it would be cheaper to go for the Video on Demand IPTV services. 

If you are only interested in watching a couple of movies or a TV show, then the TV on Demand option would work. 

## Are IPTV services available in all countries? 

IPTV services are available in most countries, but you still need to check if it is available in your country. It is always best to go with a trusted provider with an established reputation.

## Should you use a VPN with IPTV services?

VPN stands for Virtual Private Network and it allows you to use the internet in a secure and anonymous fashion. VPN's also work well with IPTV services.

Some IPTV services have been blocked by their Internet Service Provider, but using a VPN ensures that your streaming content will not get blocked. 

VPN's also sometimes have better performance for streaming content.

Before you consider using a VPN, you need to check on two things:

1. Does your country allow the use of VPNs?
2. Does your IPTV service support VPNs?

IPTV services can work with a variety of devices including computers, smart TVs, mobile phones, tablets, and more. You can also use internet TV sticks and boxes for IPTV services.
