If you work with WordPress, then you know just how important a good stack of plugins is. They were designed to improve everything from media handling, and basic features to security and more.

You can have as many as you like, in theory, but don't go overboard. A good rule of thumb is to keep the number of plugins to a minimum. In my \[Ultimate WordPress guide\](https://www.weblime.com/stories/the-ultimate-wordpress-guide), I explain that my soft limit is around 10.

This doesn't mean that a site with 12 or 13 plugins is bad. It means you should do your best to question each plugin installation and justify the need for it.

Keep in mind that the fewer plugins you have, the less troubleshooting you’ll have to do when something goes wrong. It’s also a good idea to avoid having multiple plugins that perform the same function. Not only can they conflict and cause issues, it's just more to manage without any real benefit.

But with so many plugins out there on the web, it can be hard to choose. To help you out, I’ve compiled a list of 15 plugins that are essential for boosting your productivity as a developer and as a businessperson.

# Best WordPress Plugins

## Akismet Spam

[According to their docs](https://akismet.com/wordpress/), Akismet checks the comments and contact form submissions on your site against their global database of spam. If the plugin finds a match, it automatically marks it as spam, thus preventing your website from publishing malicious content.

This can save you the tens of hours of tedious work you would otherwise have to put into fighting spambots. These bots post the same comment on millions of websites, usually advertising websites that have nothing to do with your blog.

If you decide to leave these comments on your website, you risk infecting your visitors’ computers with various viruses, as this is what is hiding behind most of the spam links.

Spam comments can also hurt your SEO efforts as your website will automatically point links to suspicious websites.

It’s very easy to stay protected against these attacks just by installing Akismet. Once you add it to your WordPress website you just need to activate it.

Akismet has an [average rating of 4.7 stars](https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/akismet/reviews/) out of 5 from 926 reviews.

## WordFence Security

According to [PurpleSec](https://purplesec.us/resources/cyber-security-statistics/), cybercrime went up by a staggering 600% due to the COVID-19 pandemic. A great way to protect your WordPress installation is to add a security plugin.

Wordfence is the leading security plugin for WordPress. This means that a large majority of WordPress admins use it, including many who provide feedback about the plugin's bugs and functionality. This ensures that the plugin is constantly updated and gets better with each new version.

Wordfence helps you prevent hackers from exploiting your site by checking your files for vulnerabilities, scanning your site in real-time to detect malware, monitoring who accesses your site, blocking bad IPs, and more.

WordFence has an [average rating of 4.7 stars](https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/wordfence/reviews/) out of 5 from 3,737 reviews.

## WP Cerber

WP Cerber Security combines the functionality of Akismet with that of WordFence. If you want the complete suite of security features under the same plugin, then WP Cerber might be the right choice.

Cerber is an easy-to-set-up, admin-friendly anti-spam solution for protecting your contact and registration forms. Cerber Security is built with the same powerful Cerber anti-spam engine that protects comment sections on popular websites like Slashdot, Reddit, Digg, and others.

The plugin protects your site against comment spam by only allowing comments from registered users. Cerber Security offers an optional Captcha challenge form verification to further protect against bots.

Cerber CAPTCHA security is the industry's most accurate anti-spam technology available today which eliminates spam registrations and protects your contact form from automated attacks like email harvesters and bots.

WP Cerber has an [average rating of 4.9 stars](https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/wp-cerber/reviews/) out of 5 from 554 reviews, which makes it one of the best in its category in terms of user feedback.

## Yoast

Now that you have your website protected, it’s time to look at some plugins that make SEO a breeze.

Yoast is the most complete WordPress SEO plugin. It handles all aspects of optimizing your site for search engines, including keyword research, meta description, titles, and more. Yoast helps you make your website easily accessible to both humans and search engines like Google, Bing, or Yahoo.

With Yoast SEO running on your site, you'll become more familiar with SEO best practices and how the search engines view the content of your website. It’s one of the most important plugins that should be part of your WordPress stack.

Yoast is by far the most rated WordPress plugin with an [average rating of 4.8 stars](https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/wordpress-seo/reviews/) out of 5 from 27,414 reviews.

Rankmath saves you time by providing rich keyword suggestions based on popular questions. You can use these questions as they are or add them to your keywords to make them more relevant for Google's algorithm.

Moreover, RankMath will automatically generate schema markup for you that includes all possible types of information including location, contact details, and opening hours (where they make sense, of course).

Some people found RankMath to be better than Yoast when it comes to improving rankings, while others like to stick with the classic.

RankMath has an [average rating of 4.9 stars](https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/seo-by-rank-math/reviews/) out of 5 from 3,874 reviews.

## Newsletter Glue

SEO plugins are a great way to boost your traffic, but what are you going to do with so many users? The answer is simple – subscribe them to your newsletter.

Newsletter Glue is a WordPress plugin that instantly turns your blog into a newsletter.

You can get the plugin for free and upgrade once your email list grows. It’s important to mention that if you are currently using another newsletter app, you will need to upgrade before you can migrate your contact list.

Newsletter Glue is rather new but packs an [average rating of 5 stars](https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/newsletter-glue/reviews/) out of 5 from 12 reviews.

This makes it easy to publish photos and videos from multiple Instagram accounts without having to post to each account individually.
