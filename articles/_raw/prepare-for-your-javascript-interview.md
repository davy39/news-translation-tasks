Are you preparing for a JavaScript interview and want to ensure that you have a deep understanding of closures, functions, and currying? Then Roadside Coder's video course is just what you need.

We just published a full course on the freeCodeCamp.org YouTube channel that will help prepare you for a JavaScript technical interview.

In this comprehensive course, you'll learn about various aspects of JavaScript, including function declarations, expressions, scopes, and hoisting, as well as advanced concepts like closures and lexical scope. You'll also gain an understanding of currying and its practical applications in JavaScript.

The course begins with an introduction and an overview of function declarations and expressions, anonymous functions, and first-class functions. You'll also learn about Immediately Invoked Function Expressions (IIFE) and how they can be used in interviews. The course then delves into closures and function scopes, including hoisting and parameter vs. argument differences.

The course also covers callback functions, arrow functions, and lexical scope. You'll learn how to implement closures and apply them in practical situations. With a series of interview questions and exercises, you'll also have the chance to test your knowledge and apply what you've learned.

In addition to closures, the course covers the concept of currying and its various applications. You'll learn what currying is and how to use it in various situations, such as reusing variables for logic, infinite currying, manipulating the DOM, and partial application.

Roadside Coder, a full-stack developer and popular course creator, guides you through each section of the course with clear and concise instructions. He breaks down complex concepts into easily understandable terms, making the course suitable for both beginners and experienced developers looking to improve their JavaScript knowledge.

By the end of the course, you'll have a deep understanding of closures, functions, and currying, as well as the ability to apply this knowledge in practical situations. You'll also be well-equipped to answer JavaScript interview questions related to closures and functions.
