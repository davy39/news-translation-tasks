In the wake of the recent controversy surrounding Unity's pricing changes, many game developers have found themselves at a crossroads. The new pricing model proposed by Unity not only shook the indie developer community but led to a significant number of developers contemplating a switch to alternative game engines.

If you find yourself among those looking for a fresh start, transitioning to Godot could be a venture worth considering. With a more developer-friendly pricing model and a growing community, Godot is fast becoming a viable alternative to Unity.

We just published a Godot crash course on the freeCodeCamp.org YouTube channel. Omar Zaki created the course. He is a seasoned game developer and has created many popular game development tutorials.

This course is designed to equip you with the fundamental skills required to kickstart your game development journey with Godot. Although tailored for developers transitioning from Unity, the course is an excellent fit for anyone new to the game development realm. Omar will teach you the basics of Godot and in the process you will create a simplistic yet engaging Flappy Bird game.

Here are the sections in this course:

**Intro**:  
Delve into the core objective of the course and what you can expect to achieve upon completion.

**Creating Project**:  
Kickstart your Godot adventure by setting up your first project.

**Step 1 - Godot UI**:  
Familiarize yourself with Godot's user-friendly interface, a significant step towards mastering the engine.

**Step 2 - Physics and Programming**:  
Delve into the heart of game development with an introduction to physics and programming in Godot.

**Step 3 - Spawning Objects**:  
Learn the art of spawning objects, a crucial skill in the realm of game development.

**Step 4 - Logic and UI**:  
Enhance your game with logic and user interface elements to provide an enriched gaming experience.

**Outro**:  
Reflect on the journey and explore the next steps in your game development career with Godot.

As you follow along with this course, the transition from Unity to Godot will feel less like a leap and more like a natural progression. With each section, you'll find yourself becoming more adept at navigating Godot's environment, bringing your game development ideas to fruition.

The world of game development is vast, and Godot is a beacon for those looking to explore new horizons. Watch the [course on the freeCodeCamp.org YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1EFKe24X8vI) (1-hour watch).
