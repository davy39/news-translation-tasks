Hello, everyone. I’d like to tell you about what I learned by attending the just concluded Google I/O Extended hosted by GDG Warri. [Charles Freeborn Eteure](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/what-i-learnt-from-io18extended-warri-9e7142e7a4c5/undefined), who was the organizer, was really amazing — thumbs up sir! I also met an astonishing UI/UX designer — Miss [Perrie](https://twitter.com/PerrieFidelis) — and her talk on the importance of good design was marvelous.

This quote kept coming to mind:

> Develop a passion for learning. If you do, you will never cease to grow — Anthony J. D’Angelo

So, I was very humbled to see quite a number of young people turning up to attend this event, even though it was the first of its kind in Warri. At the event, I was approach by many people who wanted to know how to get started learning web development or programming in general.

Those questions opened my eyes to some valuable lessons:

1. Young folks are really eager to learn about the whole tech ecosystem.
2. There is a need for guidance for the young upcoming developers.
3. The whole idea of what developers do is still hazy to most people in Delta State.
4. There is a deficit in the knowledge of where to get resources or seek help.
5. More awareness needs to be spread in order to re-orient the mindset of Deltans about technology in general.

With all these lessons in mind, I want to point out some cool resources and also give some advice I think will be helpful for any beginner developer (especially to the young developers-to-be from #IO18Extedended).

### Advice to young developers

#### K**now the why before the how**.

What this means is that you have to know **why** you want to get into tech. It’s not so much knowing it intellectually, but you have to know it emotionally (and have a strong conviction) as well.

This is necessary because, like anything worth learning, development in general is difficult but do-able. So I reckon having a strong tangible reason is a formidable force in keeping you coding and moving forward in those trying times of frustration or a coding rut.

#### Attitude is everything

You have to maintain a learning attitude. What you don’t know, ask and read about (in any order you want) and you have to do it daily. Coding is a skill, and like any skill you get better at it by doing it. This [article](https://medium.com/career-change-coder/understanding-your-individual-learning-styles-in-relation-to-learning-to-code-3ad24ebec551) is great at pointing out what learning style will suit your uniqueness.

#### Go back to the fundamentals

Lastly and most importantly (I think), development is both an art and a science. Like both fields, it has rudiments — learn them. It has pioneers (top dogs, senior developers, mentors) — find them and follow them closely. It is challenging — embrace it (because it makes you better). And it is geared towards fostering solutions to new problems or making an old solution better — focus on that!

### Checkout these resources and articles

Oh and before I forget — this [article](https://blog.usejournal.com/web-development-am-i-doing-this-right-ff857a22fa18) has links to useful resources that may be of help on your journey — if you are just starting out, do check it out.
