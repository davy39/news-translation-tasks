Django REST Framework is a powerful and flexible toolkit for building Web APIs.

We just released a course on the freeCodeCamp.org YouTube channel that will teach you how to use Python and the Django REST Framework (DRF) to build a web API.

Bobby Stearman developed this course. Bobby has created many popular software courses on both his own channel and the freeCodeCamp.org channel.

The Django REST Framework provides a full suite of features for developing RESTful APIs, including serialization, authentication, authorization, and throttling. It also makes it easy to manage the data that is stored in the database, allowing developers to quickly make changes to the data model and maintain a clean, consistent codebase.

Here is what you will do in this course:

* Clone the code and set up our system
* Add settings and URL configurations
* Create first API endpoint
* Write unit tests
* Create endpoints with authentication
* Create item and order models and serializers
* Code viewsets and routers
* Write final unit tests

Watch the full course on [the freeCodeCamp.org YouTube channel](https://youtu.be/tujhGdn1EMI) (2-hour watch).
