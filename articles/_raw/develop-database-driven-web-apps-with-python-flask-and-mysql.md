Are you ready to take your web development skills to the next level? Do you want to learn how to build dynamic database-driven web applications with Python, Flask, and MySQL? 

We just published a comprehensive video course on the freeCodeCamp.org YouTube channel that is designed to teach you how to build and deploy a production-ready database-driven web application using Python and Flask.

Akash created this course. He is the CEO of Jovian and he has created many popular courses.

The course is divided into two parts, each with its own set of objectives, covering everything from Flask basics to MySQL database setup, and application deployment.

In Part 1, you will learn how to build and deploy a site using the Flask Python web framework. You will start by creating a "Jovian Careers" website that lists job openings at Jovian.

You will also learn how to use a modern HTML & CSS framework for layout and styling, as well as how to deploy the website to the cloud and attach a custom domain. By the end of Part 1, you will have a working website that is ready to be connected to a database.

In Part 2, you will connect the Flask application from the first part to a cloud MySQL database, and learn how to deploy a production-ready database-driven web application. You will start by setting up the project and deployment, then move on to cloud MySQL database setup, and DB connection with SQLAlchemy. 

You will learn how to display DB data on web pages, create dynamic database-driven pages, and build an HTML form for applications. Finally, you will learn how to save applications to the database, and wrap up the course by summarizing the topics covered and outlining future work.

By the end of the course, you will have the knowledge and skills needed to build and deploy a production-ready database-driven web application. This will not only enhance your skills as a developer but also open up new career opportunities. You will also have a deep understanding of Flask and MySQL, which will enable you to apply these skills to other projects.

So, if you're ready to take your web development skills to the next level, star watching [this 5-hour course](https://youtu.be/yBDHkveJUf4) and continue your journey towards becoming a master web developer!
