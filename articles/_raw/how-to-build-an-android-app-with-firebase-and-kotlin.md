Rahul Pandey is an app developer and Facebook engineer. He has created many apps that are currently on the app store and he made a tutorial to show you how he created one of those apps.

We've released the course on the freeCodeCamp.org YouTube channel. In the course,  you will learn how to build an Android app in Kotlin which allows users to update their status using only emoji 😇🐼❤️.

The app combines various Firebase services (Authentication, Cloud Functions, and Firestore) to allow users to update and view emoji-only statuses. The user is able to create or sign in to their account with Google.

Here are the sections covered in this course:

* App architecture
* Firebase Authentication logic
* User sign up Cloud Function
* Display user emoji list
* Update emoji status
* Restrict input to emoji

**Watch the [full course on the freeCodeCamp.org YouTube channel](https://youtu.be/rfdQHOB3jCU) (1.5 hour watch).**
