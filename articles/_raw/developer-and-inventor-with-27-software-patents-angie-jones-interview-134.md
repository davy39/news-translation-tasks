On this week's episode of the podcast, freeCodeCamp founder Quincy Larson interviews Angie Jones. She's a developer and holder of 27 software patents. She's worked at companies like IBM and Twitter, doing both test engineering and developer advocacy.

We talk about:

* How a bad performance review from her boss early in her career taught her to be less timid and more vocal about her ideas.
    
* How she invented lots of software testing processes and holds 27 software patents.
    
* Her work at IBM, Twitter, and other big tech companies.
    
* How feature development and test development are completely different disciplines, which each require dedicated practice and their own mindsets
    
* Her interest in the game Second Life and the possibility of virtual worlds
    
* How she uses AI for debugging and test engineering
    

Can you guess what song I'm playing on my bass during the intro? It's a 1992 Acid Jazz song.
