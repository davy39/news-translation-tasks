Many companies use code from open source projects in the modern world of software development. 

This approach not only benefits those organizations but also different developers working on different projects. And it has created an environment where developers are able to work in a collaborative manner while also learning from each other.

Just like any other field of development, open source isn't easy if you don't know what you are looking for and where to look. 

For the past few years since my first publication about [How to Contribute to Open Source Projects – A Beginner's Guide](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-contribute-to-open-source-projects-beginners-guide/), I have had people reach out, appreciating the article and how it helped them. There have been others who wanted more guidance on how to navigate the open source field.

Most questions that I get range from "How can I find the correct projects and programs to work on", to "Can I really make a living through open-source", or "Most programs I find aren't beginner friendly, how should I proceed?", just to mention a few. 

Well, I can relate to these questions, because at some point I was in the same situation but never got the answers I wanted until later on. 

If you're in the same situation and you have questions about open source, relax – I gotcha.

One thing that I can assure you is that participating in open-source can be beneficial if you find the correct path. That correct path can be either through joining a project or just contributing to a codebase. There are many ways to help. And then you'll have numerous opportunities to develop your skills and grow as a developer. 

The good thing about open source is it accommodates everyone, whether you are a student, professional, or an open-source enthusiast. Open source projects can provide you with a unique platform for learning, collaborating, and showcasing your skills. After all, **there is something for everyone**.

With that said, let's get started!

## What is Open Source?

Before we get started reviewing different open-source projects, let's first have a recap of what open source is and why you should consider joining in. 

Open source code is code that is made available to the public to not only view and use but also modify and distribute under a permissive license. 

As a developer, contributing to open-source can be rewarding and can help you learn, teach others, and grow your skills. 

Apart from this, there are plenty other reasons why you should consider contributing to open source, including:

* You get an opportunity to improve the software you rely on daily.
* Through the process you can find a mentor if you need one.
* You will be able to learn new skills or improve on existing ones.
* You get to share and showcase your skills to others.
* In the process you can gain a deeper understanding of a given technology.
* It's a good way to build your reputation and grow your career.

## Types of Open Source Projects

Now that you have an understanding of what open-source is and some of its benefits, let's learn about the different types of open-source projects that are available for aspiring contributors. 

From education to internships to hackathons, there are numerous opportunities for you to improve your skills, gain practical experience, earn a living, and make valuable contributions to the open-source community.

These projects offer a unique opportunity for developers of all levels to learn and gain experience while working on real-world projects. The open source community is also a place where like-minded individuals from around the world get to connect and share. 

Now, with so many projects available, it can be challenging for beginners in the field to know where exactly to begin. To make it easier, after a little research, I was able to classify the projects into six main categories, that is: 

* Education and Training 
* Internships and Mentorships 
* Grants and Funding
* Community Building & Advocacy
* Research and Development

These categories house different projects, making it easier for you to know exactly what you are looking for. 

If after reading this article you feel like I'm missing a certain type of project that might be helpful, you can head over to GitHub and add it to this repo dedicated to listing all open-source projects for easy access: [Awesome-Open-Source-Programs](https://github.com/larymak/Awesome-Open-Source-Programs).
