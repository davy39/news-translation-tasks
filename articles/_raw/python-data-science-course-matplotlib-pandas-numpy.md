This free 12-hour Python Data Science course will take you from knowing nothing about Python to being able to analyze data. You'll learn basic Python, along with powerful tools like Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib.

This is a hands-on course and you will practice everything you learn step-by-step.  

This course includes [a full codebase for your reference](https://github.com/datapublishings/Course-python-data-science).   

It kicks off with a one-hour introduction to basic programming concepts, problem solving, and pseudocode.

Then it walks you through how to install both Python and the powerful Anaconda data science platform. 

Next, the course will show you how to launch your own Jupyter Notebook. This is a popular way of creating documents with interactive code embedded.

Jupyter Notebooks run right inside of peoples' browsers. This makes them easy to share and to use – even for non-programmers. This has made them a long-time favorite tool of the data science community.

Here are some other topics this course will cover:

* Coding on the iPython Shell
* Variables and Operators in Python 
* Booleans and Comparisons in Python
* Python Useful functions
* Control Flow in Python
* Functions in Python
* Modules in Python
* Strings in Python
* Other important Python Data Structures: Lists, Tuples, Sets, and Dictionaries
* The NumPy Data Science Python Library 
* The Pandas Data Science Python Library 
* The Matplotlib Data Science Python Library

And finally, you'll see all of these tools working in concert as part of a basic COVID-19 trend analyzer app.

You can watch the course below, or watch it [on the freeCodeCamp.org YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHBE6Q9XlzI) (12 hour watch).
