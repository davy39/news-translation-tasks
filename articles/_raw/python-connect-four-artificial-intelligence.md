Learn how to create an expert level artificial intelligence to play Connect Four using Python. The concepts you learn in this tutorial from Keith Galli can apply to creating AIs for other games as well.

The tutorial starts out with a very simple implementation, then progresses to choosing a column based on score. Finally, the minimax algorithm is implemented with alpha beta pruning.

You can watch the full video course on the [freeCodeCamp.org YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8392NJjj8s0) (1.5 hour watch).
