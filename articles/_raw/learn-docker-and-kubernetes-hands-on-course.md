Docker and Kubernetes are important technologies that can help you scale your applications.

Docker is a platform for packaging, deploying, and running applications in containers. Kubernetes is a system for managing containerized applications across a cluster of nodes. It provides basic mechanisms for deployment, maintenance, and scaling of applications.

We just published a 6-hour course on the freeCodeCamp.org YouTube channel that will provide you with a hand-on introduction to Docker and Kubernetes.

Guy Barrette teaches this Docker Containers and Kubernetes Fundamentals course for beginners. Guy is a developer & trainer with more than 25 years of experience. He is a Microsoft MVP, frequent conference speaker, and was the leader of the Montreal .NET User Group for more than 23 years. All this is to say that he is the perfect person to teach you about Docker and Kubernetes.

Learn how to containerize applications with the Docker CLI and Visual Studio Code. Learn how to use push and pull container images on Docker Hub, a container registry, and create multi-container applications using Docker Compose. Learn about the Kubernetes architecture and how it works. Run it locally and use the Kubernetes CLI and Visual Studio Code to run, debug and troubleshoot applications and services. Learn about pods and the different workloads available.
