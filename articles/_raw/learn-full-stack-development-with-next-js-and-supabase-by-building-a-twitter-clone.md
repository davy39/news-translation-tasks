We just launched a course on the freeCodeCamp.org YouTube channel that will help you master full stack development with Next.js 13 and Supabase by building a Twitter clone. The course also uses Tailwind CSS and TypeScript.

This intensive course has been expertly developed by Pranjal Soni, who brings a wealth of experience and a passion for teaching complex coding concepts in an accessible and understandable way.

The course is designed around a project-based learning approach, providing you with the opportunity to gain hands-on experience as you create a functional, full-stack Twitter clone. In addition to building your practical skills, the project will also serve as a powerful portfolio piece that can showcase your ability to develop and manage a complex full-stack project.

Here's a brief rundown of what you can expect from the course:

**Twitter Intro & Building the Ultimate Twitter Clone**: Get introduced to the project and dive right into the exciting task of creating a Twitter clone using Next.js 13, Tailwind CSS, TypeScript, and Supabase.

**Building Twitter Layouts**: Learn how to develop the visually appealing layouts that make Twitter so user-friendly, from the left sidebar to the timeline and the trending section.

**Designing Twitter Clone PostgreSQL Database**: Harness the power of ChatGPT and dbdiagram to design a PostgreSQL database tailored for a Twitter-like application.

**Authentication with Supabase**: Set up user authentication in your Next.js 13 application using Supabase.

**Handling Tweets**: Master how to save, fetch, and manage tweets in your application's database using Next.js Server Actions and Supabase.

**Implementing Tweet Features**: From a Like/Unlike feature to a Tweet Reply function, you'll gain practical experience in adding the essential features that Twitter users know and love.

**Optimization and Debugging**: Learn about optimizing your web application for better performance and experience debugging by fixing a real bug in your Twitter clone.

**Drizzle ORM Schema and Complex Queries**: Use ChatGPT to build a Drizzle ORM schema from SQL and learn how to join tables and build complex queries using Drizzle ORM.

By the end of the course, you'll have a firm grasp on full-stack development, with practical experience in Next.js 13, Tailwind CSS, TypeScript, and Supabase. Not only will you have your own Twitter clone as proof of your new skills, but you'll also be well-equipped to take on your own full-stack projects in the future.

The course is entirely free, reflecting freeCodeCamp.org's commitment to providing accessible and high-quality coding education to all. So why wait?
