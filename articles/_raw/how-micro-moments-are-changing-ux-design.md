We live in a constantly evolving mobile world. People of almost every age are glued to their smartphones. Some are busy browsing FaceBook, others are watching the news, and still others opt for online shopping.

Mobile devices are a part of our lives now, and it's hard to stop peering at our screens and see the world around us. Because of this, companies are starting to keenly observe how customers prioritize their interactions with their devices.

Brands are continuously fighting with their competitors for their customer's attention. It's all about retention, engagement, and conversion. 

An [Adobe Report](https://blogs.adobe.com/creative/files/2015/12/Adobe-State-of-Content-Report.pdf) says that **66 percent of consumers** love to read and engage with beautifully designed and easy to navigate web and mobile apps.

**This is where User Experience Design, or UX design, comes into play.**

You have to incorporate thoughtful UX elements into your website or app. And the key to optimizing user experience is to establish UX nodes, which will help you track even the smallest consumer actions. These tiny engagements are called **micro-moments.**

Here, I will share my views about the touch points to consider while designing for user experience around the customer journey map. This will help you bridge both worlds and connect with your target users.

## What is a micro-moment?

**But before that, let's understand what exactly Micro-moments are.**

A user’s interaction with a website or app consists of millions of micro-moments. It could be anything from browsing the app to navigating across the menu buttons in a pre-defined and predestined navigation scenario. 

All these little interactions summed up together constitute micro-moments.

In simple words, the user's tiniest action on a website or application is termed a **Micro-Moment.**

Brain Barrus, president of Studio-Element, explains micro-moments as one way to eliminate the friction between all those steps a user goes while interacting with the app or web. And he argues that there are only pre-set objectives that micro-moments let the owner and designer achieve.

## Micro-moment example: an eCommerce website

What leads to a thriving business conversion process? 

What if a user exits your app without making a purchase? This is possible if they can't find the purchase button, can’t find the right filter or sorting options, or if your site does not provide a seamless user experience.

Or maybe the customer simply can't find the CVV number on their card and thus could not make the payment. So you should provide a brief explanation of where those numbers can be found. It might be that easy.

In the end, if the customer abandons their cart and don't purchase anything, you need to track down what didn’t work for them. 

This means making the necessary changes in your site's design while keeping in mind the micro-interactions your customers will perform and experience.

## How do you optimize for these micro-moments?

Good UX design is key to an excellent customer experience. As an entrepreneur, you need to be aware of and take into account the minutest aspects of your site. 

**UX analytics** is the best way to optimize micro-moments and fine-tune great customer experiences.

Elements such as button size and checkbox placement are the primary candidates for micro-moment optimization. 

These days designers discover significant micro-moments through tactics such as rapid prototypes and real-time real-user testing. These strategies provide insights into what customers are looking for and what ultimately leads them to make a purchase.

When you discuss the size of a button, it might seem like an insignificant change that you can ignore. But these kinds of small changes, when combined, lead to significant variations in the results.

UX and UI work together and can make a big difference for your users. Designers who rely on **modern analytics, consumer testing, and rapid prototyping** can get an in-depth analysis of even the smallest details of how their website or app works. 

To increase customer retention and conversions, UX designers should look to optimize the user experience by focusing on micro-moments in several ways. Let's look at each of them now.

### 1: Look for new trends in design

Search for new trends and do some research to see how other designers are experimenting with micro-moments. Optimize your site accordingly and set a new benchmark for user interactions.

You can introduce newer functionalities and, at times, ask for feedback in between. This will help you deploy actions that are both different and don't interrupt the user's flow on your site.

### 2: Adopt a mobile/responsive approach to design

Mobile versions of sites are used more often nowadays than desktop versions, since people are more mobile. Designers should take into account all screen sizes across all devices. 

To help your team do this, you can conduct real-time testing and welcome feedback from your users to see what kinds of devices they're using most.

Brian Solis, a digital analyst and futurist, says that the mobile universe is built on micro-moments and designers need to adopt this and re-imagine the customer journey for a mobile world. UI must be multi-functional and must be in the inflow of design.

### 3: Don’t underestimate the entertainment factor

When designing a user interface, designers often ignore the user's experience and downplay entertainment. But this can be a mistake.

Try to incorporate small and subtle animations, like a rollover or hover effect, and other small entertaining factors in your website or app. These will help entice your users to stay longer.

If you do this, your users will notice or interact with every minute detail and they'll get what they want at the same time. 

As an example, check out the below image showing how Delaware advertises a 10 day fair for kids. The parents can visit the website to pre book tickets in advance, making the experience better for everyone.

Users can easily discover whatever they want to know. They learn the fair's dates in advance – probably the most common question people ask, so they put it right up front. The easily navigable menu options prompt the user to book their tickets and convert that traffic into sales.

As you can see, you need to understand the customer journey. You need to know their requirements, and how those needs can be met by applying design principles. 

[Google](https://www.thinkwithgoogle.com/consumer-insights/consumer-journey/micro-moments-understand-new-consumer-behavior/) describes micro-moments as a stack of four game-changing moments that really matter for your business:

* I want to know
* I want to go
* I want to do
* I want to buy

Think from your user's perspective and you will be good to go. Designing for these micro-moments will help you reach your customers in their time of need. And if you're successful, you will increase your mobile site conversion rate over time.

### 4: **Users should be freely able to interact with the website and give important feedback**

Designers should design the website or application in a way that allows users to get their ideas or opinions in front of the website owner. This is a vital part of micro-moment decisions and helps users interact freely with the website.

For example, a simple like button or emojis depicting multiple emotions integrated into the website can also act as feedback.

## What’s Next? A new way of thinking

As long as people are so engaged with their palm-sized screens, UX design should change accordingly.

And micro-moments are big here. You need to rethink how these small, tiny details, when summed up together, can become revolutionary. 

Making these changes will help you deliver exactly what your users want - all through an electronic rectangle that seamlessly fits into their hands. 

Micro-Moments, when perfectly timed, help you incorporate great features and functionality to a product.
