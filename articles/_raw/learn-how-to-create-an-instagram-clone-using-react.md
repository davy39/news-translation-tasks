There are a lot of tutorials about building clones of popular web apps but most of them are short and don't cover very many features. 

We just released a massive 12-hour course that will show you how to create your own version of Instagram. This course is a lot more comprehensive than most other courses on creating web app clones.

Karl Hadwen developed this course. Karl has created many popular courses that are on his own channel and the freeCodeCamp.org channel.

The project you will create in this course uses React (including custom hooks, useContext, useState, useEffect, & useRef), Firebase, Tailwind CSS, LoadTest, Lighthouse, Vercel, React Testing Library, and Cypress E2E Testing.

You will learn to create multiple pages, including a login page, a sign up page, a dashboard (to view/like/comment on photos), and user profiles. The sign-in page will connect to Firebase when a user tries to sign in. When a user signs up, the app uses Firebase auth to store the user in the Firebase auth database.

You will even learn how to fully deploy the app using Vercel.
