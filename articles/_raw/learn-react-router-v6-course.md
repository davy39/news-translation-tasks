If you're building projects with React, you should learn how to use React Router.

We just posted a course on the freeCodeCamp.org YouTube channel that covers everything you need to know about routing with React using React Router v6. The course will help you master this essential library for single-page applications. 

React Router is the standard routing library for React, enabling you to implement dynamic routing in a web application. 

With React Router, you can handle navigation from one view to another without the page refreshing, which is crucial for building fast and user-friendly single-page applications. It allows you to define routes, navigate between them, pass parameters, and manage state transitions smoothly.
