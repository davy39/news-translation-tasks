Would you survive the TV show Squid Game? Would you survive coding the TV show Squid Game?

Time to find out.

We just published a JavaScript course on the freeCodeCamp.org YouTube channel that will teach you how to create the Red Light / Green Light game from Squid Game.

You will use Three.js and you will learn how to use a 3d model in a JavaScript game.
