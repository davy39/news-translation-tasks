Transform your development approach and embrace the power of Elixir and functional programming with our new beginner's course. It is designed to help you build scalable, maintainable applications like never before.

We just published a new course on the freeCodeCamp channel that will teach you how to build your own Elixir applications and apply functional programming concepts in your projects.

Octallium developed this course. He is an experienced developer and has shared other popular courses for the freeCodeCamp channel.

Elixir, a dynamic, functional programming language built on the Erlang Virtual Machine (BEAM), offers remarkable concurrency, fault-tolerance, and distributed computing capabilities. Its functional programming paradigm makes it an ideal choice for scalable and maintainable applications. This course will help you gain a solid understanding of Elixir and its underlying principles, setting you on the path to becoming a proficient developer.

The course covers a wide range of topics, starting with an introduction to Elixir and functional programming. You'll learn about recursion and its importance in functional programming, as well as how to install Elixir and set up Visual Studio Code for a seamless development experience.

As you progress, you'll explore pattern matching and the powerful LiveBook, which allows you to create interactive and collaborative notebooks in Elixir. You'll also gain an in-depth understanding of immutability and the Actor Model, both of which are fundamental to Elixir's design.

Diving into Elixir's rich data types, you'll learn about atoms, strings, charlists, processes, lists, tuples, keyword lists, maps, and structs. You'll also discover how to effectively control the flow of your Elixir applications, and create Mix projects to organize your code.

The course emphasizes the importance of recursion, and you'll get hands-on experience with head and tail recursion, as well as practical examples like summing digits, calculating factorials, and reversing numbers. You'll also delve into list operations, including summing, reversing, mapping, concatenating, and flat mapping.

To reinforce your learning, our course includes a mid-review, practical projects like the "Seven Wonders" and "Expense Manager," and a final assessment of your understanding of Elixir and functional programming.

So, are you prepared to unlock the full potential of Elixir and functional programming? Watch the full course [on the freeCodeCamp.org YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IiIgm_yaoOA) (5-hour watch).
