For many students who are passionate about technology, limited access to crucial tools and resources is a common challenge. 

Fortunately, the GitHub Student Developer Pack comes to the rescue. This pack provides students with exclusive access to a variety of top-notch developer tools, allowing them to learn through practical experience.

## What is the GitHub Student Developer Pack?

The Student Developer Pack is made up of a selection of benefits generously provided by GitHub's partners and collaborators. These partners joined forces with GitHub to extend these valuable offers to verified students. 

Why? Because they understand that the most effective way to support future developers is by offering hands-on experience with industry-standard products and tools. 

In essence, the GitHub Student Developer Pack eliminates the obstacles faced by students who are passionate about technology but may not have the resources to pay full price for all these tools. 

The pack grants students access to a collection of resources and empowers them to acquire firsthand knowledge and skills through the use of cutting-edge tools. 

In this article, I will touch on some of the highlights of the GitHub Student Developer Pack and how you can access to it. 

## Highlights of the Student Developer Pack

And then, my personal favourite...

### The [GitHub Campus Experts Program](https://githubcampus.expert/)

The GitHub Campus Expert program is geared towards empowering University students to become student leaders while advocating for technology and open-source collaboration. 

Campus Experts are trained to organize events, mentor other students, and foster/build a strong tech community on their respective campuses. 

But it's important to note that the GitHub Student Developer Pack is a prerequisite for being able to apply for the program.

## What Are the Requirements to Get a Student Developer Pack?

To be eligible for the GitHub Student Developer Pack, you must meet the following requirements:

* You must be a minimum of 13 years of age.
* You must have a user account on [GitHub](http://github.com/).
* You must possess a school-issued email address that can be verified, or alternatively, provide documents as evidence of your current student status.
* At the point of your application, you must be currently registered in a program that grants a degree or diploma.

To gain further insights into the application process and the types of documents that are accepted, I encourage you to check the comprehensive [Education documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/education/explore-the-benefits-of-teaching-and-learning-with-github-education/github-global-campus-for-students/apply-to-github-global-campus-as-a-student).

## How Do I Get this Pack?

First, you'll need to visit [GitHub Education](https://education.github.com/pack). Sign in with your GitHub Account by clicking the `Sign-in` button on the top-right corner.

Then click on the `Sign up for Student Developer Pack` button.

You will be required to fill a form. The questions in the form are as follows:

* _What e-mail address do you use for school?_

If you have a school-issued email, select (or add) it. It is important to note that these email addresses must be verified.

From my experience, selecting a school-issued email address gives you the best chance of a speedy review.

If you don’t have a school-issued email, follow the prompts to fill out some additional information. You will still be eligible even if you only have a personal email address, as long as you can provide alternative documentation to verify your current student status.

* _What is the name of your school?_

This prompt is automatically filled out if you provided a valid student email. However, if your school is not listed, then you need to enter your school's full name and continue. You will be asked to provide further information about your school on the next page.
