On this week's episode of the podcast, freeCodeCamp founder Quincy Larson interviews Edidiong Asikpo. Didi is a software engineer. She grew up in Lagos, the biggest city in Nigeria and the biggest tech hub in Africa.

Didi got into medical school. But while waiting for her studies to start, she started studying computer science and got really into it. She graduated with a CS degree and has worked in tech for nearly a decade. She now works at MongoDB, a cloud database company, remotely from her home in London.

We talk about:

* Nigeria's tech scene
    
* How to break into tech when you live outside the Silicon Valley ecosystem
    
* How to transition from one programming language to another (Didi moved from mobile apps -&gt; DevOps)
    
* How writing programming tutorials can help you become a better developer
