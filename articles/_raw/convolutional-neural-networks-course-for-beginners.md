We just published a course on the freeCodeCamp.org YouTube channel that will teach you all about Convolutional Neural Networks. Then you will build a project that can determine if an image is a hot dog or not a hot dog!

Kylie Ying developed this course. She is a software engineer at Google and is passionate about Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence. 

Convolutional Neural Networks are a class of deep neural networks that are extensively used in image and video recognition. The course begins by laying the foundation with essential concepts such as supervised learning and model training. As you progress, the course delves into the nitty-gritty of neural networks, covering important aspects like activation functions and backpropagation.

What sets this course apart is the exciting and practical approach it takes. You’ll not just be learning theories but applying them. You will build your very own “Hot Dog or Not Hot Dog” app! This project, inspired by the hit show Silicon Valley, allows you to apply the concepts you have learned in a fun and practical way. You will understand the intricacies of gathering and preprocessing data, implementing neural networks, and optimizing their performance.

This course is a great opportunity for anyone interested in AI and ML. Whether you’re a beginner or someone with prior knowledge looking to brush up on CNNs, Kylie Ying’s course is a resource you don’t want to miss. 

You can watch the full course on [the freeCodeCamp.org YouTube channel](https://youtu.be/nVhau51w6dM) (1.5 hour watch).
