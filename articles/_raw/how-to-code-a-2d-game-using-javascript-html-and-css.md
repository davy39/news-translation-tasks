JavaScript can be a surprisingly good programming language to use for creating 2D games. Especially games you want to be playable on almost any device. 

We just published a course on the freeCodeCamp.org YouTube channel that will teach you how to code a 2D game using JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and HTML Canvas.

Frank from Frank's Laboratory developed this course. Frank is a popular instructor and always comes up with super creative tutorials.

You will build a game completely from scratch featuring everything from sprite animation to parallax backgrounds. The game uses just HTML, CSS and plain JavaScript without frameworks or libraries.
