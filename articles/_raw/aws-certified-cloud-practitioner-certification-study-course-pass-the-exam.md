Passing the AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner Exam is one of the first steps to a career in cloud development. And freeCodeCamp just published my free 12-hour course that will help you prepare for the exam. 

This exam mostly deals with cloud computing concepts. Even if you are new to coding, you should be able to prepare for this exam and earn the AWS certification.

This entire free course is now live on YouTube, and linked below. Before you dive into it, read this guide to help you decide whether the AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner certification is for you.

## What is the AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner?

The Certified Cloud Practitioner is the **entry-level AWS certification** that goes through:

* The cloud fundamentals, for example Cloud Concepts, Cloud Architecture, and Cloud Deployment Models
* A close look at the AWS Core Services
* A quick look at the vast amount of AWS services
* Identity, Security, and Governance of the Cloud
* Billing, Pricing, and Support of AWS Services

The course code is **CLF-C01** but its commonly referred to as the **CCP**.

Amazon Web Services is the leading Cloud Service Provider (CSP) in the world and the AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner **is the most common starting point** for people breaking into the cloud industry.

Consider the AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner if:

* You are **new to cloud** and need to learn the fundamentals
* You are in the **executive, management, or sales level** and need to acquire strategic information about cloud for adoption or migration
* You are a Senior Cloud Engineer or Solutions Architect who needs to **reset or refresh** your AWS knowledge after working for multiple years

No matter your path towards a cloud role, the AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner provides fundamental knowledge that you shouldn't skip.

## How this course is different from the 2019 AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner course

This is the second edition of the AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner course released on freeCodeCamp. This edition has three times more content, and all previous content has been revised, expanded, and re-filmed. 

I made these major updates because of some important changes that have been made to the AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner exam. In general AWS has increased the difficulty of this exam.

## Overview of the AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner

The AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner is divided into 3 domains, each with their own weighting. The weighting determine the number of questions about that domain that will appear on the exam.

* Domain 1: Cloud Concepts at 26%
* Domain 2: Security and Compliance at 25%
* Domain 3: Technology at 33%
* Domain 4 Billing and Pricing at 16%

The official exam guide lists a very long list of possible services, technologies, and concepts that could appear on the exam. In actuality, only one third of the content that could appear will appear on the exam.

## How do you get Certified?

Google uses Pearson Vue and PSI test centers to deliver the exam. You can take the exam in-person or online.

If you want to schedule the exam with either testing method, you do that via [AWS Trainings Account](https://aws.amazon.com/certification/certification-prep/testing/).

There are **6**5 **multiple-choice** and **multiple-select** questions and you have to score **70% to pass**.

The AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner costs **$**100 **USD.**

## Can I simply watch the videos and pass the exam?

AWS has increased the difficulty of this exam. And while watching lecture videos is critical to passing, having hands-on experience and utilizing practice exams are essential if you want to pass the exam.

How much you need to study will vary, but on average it will require about 24 hours over 2 weeks to be prepared to successfully pass this AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner.
