On this week's episode of the podcast, freeCodeCamp founder Quincy Larson interviews Braydon Coyer. He's a software engineer who started building mobile apps in high school – one of which even out-sold Angry Birds for a few days. He dropped out of his computer science degree program once he landed his first web developer job and never went back.

We talk about:

* Mobile app development VS web app development
    
* Strategies for applying for developer roles
    
* How useful is a CS degree really?
    
* Sane ways to integrate AI into your developer workflows
