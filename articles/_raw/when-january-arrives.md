There’s always a first time to everything in life.

When January approaches and all of us take some days to think and re-think our lives, we usually make something like a decision list for the next year. Some milestones, some wishes, some dreams… Sometimes simple things like quitting something or changing something. Sometimes more than that.

Since the beginning of 2016 I’ve been trying to change or to improve some aspects that I wanted to change in my life and I’m getting thru it with success, because it only works when you really put inside your mind that’s the way to do it, that’s the way to follow the path and get hands on driving your life the way you want it to be.

This year I focused on something that has been inside my heart for a lot of years. I’ve always wanted to work on IT because since I was a kid I was totally geek about computers. When I got to the university, because a lot of questions, I’ve decided to follow Civil Engineering and in 2004 I got my MSc on it. I’ve been working for 12 years as a construction project manager or construction director. In spite of liking what I do in my job I think it’s not my first love. That real thing I wanted to do.

So this Christmas I’ve decided to follow my dream and to start the long journey to become a Software Engineer.

I’ve started reading some books and following some people on the net. I’ve started to study and I did some noob courses on codecademy.com. Then the decision of developing code got higher and I’ve discovered f[reeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/). I’ve started reading and doing the tutorials and I liked the perspective of being a Full Stack Engineer.

I’ve created a GitHub repo to track my career change at — https://github.com/evedes/careerchange_tracking

Today it’s the 15th day that I spend coding and learning about how to code or develop interesting things mainly in JS and I’m liking a lot. I really think that’s my passion, what I really want to do.

I just want to thank to [Quincy Larson](https://twitter.com/ossia) for the opportunity of meeting f[reeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/). I think it’s helping a lot to change my life. Thank u Quincy.

This is my first post so I’m making it small. If you enjoyed it don’t forget to click below!

Thank u very much,
