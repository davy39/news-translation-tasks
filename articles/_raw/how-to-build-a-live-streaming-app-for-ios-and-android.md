It's easier than you may think to create a custom live steaming app.

We just published a course on the freeCodeCamp.org YouTube channel that will teach you how to use Flutter and Agora.io to build a live streaming app that works on Android and iOS.

Tadas Petra created this course. He works for Agora.io and has created many popular programming courses.

In this course, you will learn how to build a live streaming app that allows you to stream with friends and be able to control their audio, video, and whether they are visible overall. 

The app will also be able to push the stream out to most streaming platforms including Youtube and Twitch. This is a more intermediate course that requires basic knowledge about Flutter and State Management. 

Here are the sections in this course:

* App Explanation
* State Management 
* Agora Explained
* Initializing App
* Agora UI Kit
* Initialize RTM and RTC
* Architecture
* Building Home Screen
* Basic Agora Live Video
* Creating a UID
* Setting up State
* Joining the Live Stream
* Control User Audio and Video
* Output to Streaming Platforms
* Final Showcase

Watch the full course below or on [the freeCodeCamp.org YouTube channel](https://youtu.be/hN4Q04ODOEw) (2-hour watch).
