This is a story of how I struggled to learn when I came back to school to study again for my master's ([check my blog about master's](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/cjn-why-i-abandoned-my-mba-to-get-a-masters-in-computer-science/)) after 5-years of working in corporate. Through others, I learned a lot and improved my day-to-day life. It was a great transformation.

## Struggle # 1 - Studying

**_I understand the concept, but it's not sticking in my head._**

I listened to lectures, videos, and textbooks. What did I get? Nothing and sometimes boring.

I had to think of something to retrain my brain.

**Tip 1: Writing / Typing increase knowledge retention by 50%**.  
I used to do this a lot during high school and college. I think most people know about this. But it is still a good reminder.

**Tip 2: Blog about it. This would improve your communication skills in conveying your ideas.**

_You might say: But wait, I'm not a writer and my grammar is bad. =(_  
I am not good at writing either. I remember my high school and college days, I would have someone proofread my papers and my paper would be drenched in red ink. Ouch!

_You might say: Someone already blogged about insert topic._  
I always believe each person's perspective is different. Also, this blogging is really for yourself. Don't mind them.

_You might say: I'm shy._  
Well. Another piece of advice is just to place it in draft purgatory. I have like 72 drafts consisting of ideas or notes.

_You might ask: What do I blog?_  
I found an interesting blogger before who blogs about complex technical stuff and a very simple blog post about MacBook's HDMI port. The HDMI port blog post? It was only an image and a few sentences.

It could be:

* text with pictures and an experience. Example [here](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/cjn-cashcycle-angelhack-seattle-hackathon-2018-d3f42a26ddcb/).
* text with memes and your journey. Example [here](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/cjn-why-i-abandoned-my-mba-to-get-a-masters-in-computer-science/).
* guides or instructions. Example [here](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/cjn-google-sheets-as-json-endpoint/).
* power point style. Example [here](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/cjn-understanding-hello-world-in-nodejs/).
* purely visual. Example [here](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/cjn-bubble-sort-visualized/).

_**It doesn't have to be perfect and you'll improve in no time.**_

_You might ask: What's your secret?_  
Be curious. Aside from that, I have tons of stories and I just keep blogging. I didn't use my weakness in grammar/writing as an excuse to not try blogging. I use [Grammarly](https://www.grammarly.com/) to fix my sentences.

_You might ask: Where to blog?_  
Right now an easy blog site where you can write stuff down and have a clear blog post like this is in [Medium](https://medium.com/), a blogging site. I used to blog there until they graciously accepted me here, freeCodeCamp News, as an author here.

**Tip 3: Learn something. Teach it right away.**

_You might say: I'm no expert._  
Thing is. You learned something and that makes you more than a beginner. You can say... You're now an experienced beginner.

How can an experienced beginner help?  
Easy. Help other beginners.

It can be through:

* Explaining high-level concepts.
* Pointing them in the right direction on what resources to check out.

**Tip 4: Read... Zzz.**  
I'm a guy who does not like to read so much. I just remembered reading Harry Potter or Penguin Classics.

Now listen closely, this would rewire your brain to read again.  
First, a scenario. You are given a book and It's a thousand pages thick.

_Your goal: read the entire book._  
_In your mind: What now? A thousand pages?!_  
What you will happen: you will try to read as much as you can then you get sick of reading it.

## Enter rewiring your brain.

![Image](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2019/06/image-164.png)

Change your goal: read a chapter a day.  
_You might say: It's too long and I might not be consistent with reading a chapter._

Change your goal: read a paragraph a day.  
_You might say: There might be a chance that there are too many sentences. I don't think I can stay consistent._

Change your goal: read a sentence a day.  
_You might say: Uh. Sure? That's all? I can do that._  
Haha, you fell into my trap. This is a Jedi Mind Trick. Your brain would be tricked into reading the next sentence.

Lesson: Keep your goals as small as possible. This preserves your energy to study and decrease the likelihood of mental stress.

**Tip 5: Speak up! Do presentations.**

If you got guts, create small talks for your friends and classmates.

Here's a video of my presentation in a conference:

I had tons of opportunities to practice presenting with different tech terms at the technology club at my school, [City University of Seattle](https://www.cityu.edu/).

**Tip 6: Reading while on commute.**  
_You might say: I get motion sickness._  
Two options:

Option 1 - Jedi Mind Trick. Read for 5 minutes. Then slowly increase the read time as you get comfortable.

Option 2 - Bring other materials. Study base on energy levels.  
Status - Energetic: Read a physical book or ebook. Use a laptop/tablet.  
Status - Somewhat tired from screen display: Watch an educational video .  
Status - Very tired from screen display: Read a physical book.  
Status - Dead eyes: Listen to a podcast.  
Status - No energy: Sleep.

**Tip 7: Go to local meetups.**  
Learn the next exciting thing and get to the change to network with like-minded people.

Bonus: You might get a mentor along the way.  
Mentors have helped me big time in giving me a path to follow.  
Mentors do come in all shapes and sizes. They could be with you for a short-term or long-term, and physically or virtually.

**Tip 7: Join or create a study group.**  
You are hitting two birds in one stone. You socialize and learn at the same time.

## Struggle # 2 - Too Much Distraction.

  
**_I'm so guilty of social media. I keep scrolling and scrolling. News Feed. Memes. Videos._**  


One time, I was with my local study group. I told my friend that I struggle with social media addiction. I got the greatest advice ever.

**Tip # 1 Clean your social media to defeat your endless scrolling.**

![Image](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2019/06/image-163.png)

  
_Who to lose:_

* Unfriend everyone who you don't know.
* Schoolmate? Batchmate? If you just like their posts and don't interact such as commenting, unfollow them. You'll just envy their beach photos.
* Nonsense post? Unfollow.
* Too much negativity? Unfollow.
* Too much drama? Unfollow.
* Pages with no value-added content. Unfollow.

_Who to keep:_

* Current classmates
* Mentors
* Close friends
* Family and relatives

_Who to add/follow:_

* Inspirational people
* Educational and informative bloggers
* Pages that promote awareness
* Pages that give tips and tricks related to your field.

What do you gain:

* More time. Right now, I wake up, check my social media and I would have less than 10 notifications.
* More quality. I tend to have more energy to interact with them now.

**Tip # 2 Let's bring in some fun.**  
For my downtime, I watch films related to technology. Also, I still use my social media for fun such as NBA, Legend of Zelda or other video games.

Next, I started to follow a lot of funny pages that are related to my field, technology. I have tons of these in my Instagram feeds. lol.

This way I'm having fun and learning at the same time.

How? 

If I didn't understand the meme/joke, It means I lack the knowledge and would happily google for it to understand.

I current possess 90+ tech memes in my local machine. Whoops!
