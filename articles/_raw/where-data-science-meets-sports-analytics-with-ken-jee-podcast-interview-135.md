On this week's episode of the podcast, I interview Ken Jee. Ken's a Data Scientist. He's also a Sports Analytics practitioner who works with US Team Golf and USA Basketball.

Ken hosts the excellent Ken's Nearest Neighbors podcast and the Exponential Athelete podcast.

We talk about:

* How an injury pushed Ken out of pro sports and into data science
    
* How Ken explains his statistical insights to coaches and players to help them improve their performance
    
* Why Ken doesn't think building projects is all that useful anymore. "Data Scientists should instead build products."
    
* How Ken starts and ends each day with meditation, and writes down all the ideas that pop into his head after each session.
    
* Ken's observation that: "Who is the best suited to excel in a world where AI tools are prominent? Probably the people who are building them. People in the data science domain, people who are coding – they're the most prepared to use these tools for other things."
    

Can you guess what song I'm playing on my bass during the intro? It's from a 2006 dance song, and it was originally played on a synth.
