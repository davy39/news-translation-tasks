Nearly every developer works with different tools on a daily basis to help them achieve their goals or complete specific tasks. In this post, I’ll outline the tools I use for my day to day activities. First thing I’ll like to do is define a workflow.

### What is a Workflow?

A workflow is a series of events or tasks that processes a set of data. Workflows occur across every kind of business and industry. They are the paths that describe how something goes from being a work in progress to complete, or raw to processed.

Here’s an example: I have a workflow for writing articles. I start by looking for ideas for a post. Next, I create an outline. Then writing the actual content of the post to publishing all these are series of events to achieving a task.

As a developer, I tend to make use of certain tools that help speed up the process of completing a specific task. Even though a lot of these processes might be different for everyone, I still feel the need to share this with you. In the end, no knowledge is lost, right?

### Tools I use to help speed up productivity

This is going to be a broad list so I’ll try and split them into different categories, I’ll be highlighting the tools I use when coding, writing, and other tools I think you will find helpful in general.

#### Coding Tools

**GitKraken**

_GitKraken Homepage_

I found out about this tool recently from a friend and I really love using it. I’m a big fan of using the command line over using GUI but this tool is much different. GitKraken is a GitHub client application that works just like the command line you are already used to but with intuitive UI/UX that makes for a great experience when you are using this over the command line.

**Insomnia**

_Insomnia Homepage_

This tool is another one I really like using. It is similar to Postman but also allows your query GraphQL endpoints which are cool right. Insomnia is a Powerful HTTP and GraphQL tool belt that is available on Mac, Linux and Windows platforms. Its features include GraphQL support, SVG and image previews, AWS authentication, etc.

**Visual Studio Code**

_Visual Studio Code Homepage_

[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) is a code editor that I really love using. I have been using for over a couple of years now and I’ve not found any reason to stop. With constant improvements and new features added regularly, this is my go-to choice for a code editor.

**Dash**

_Dash website_

**SourceTree**

_Sourcetree Homepage_

Ever wanted to use GUI instead of the command line for Git? Then SourceTree is your best bet. I already mentioned GitKraken and they both do the same job — I usually alternate between both apps occasionally. So I’ll say use what works best for you they are both great apps.  
   
**Postico**

_Postico Homepage_

[Postico](https://eggerapps.at/postico/) is one client app for Postgres. It has a beautiful UI and it’s easily accessible. I prefer using this to other apps I’ve found or even using the Postgres command line.

**Hyper**

[Hyper](https://hyper.is) is one tool I love using. It is, in fact, my default terminal for coding. Hyper is easily customizable with a lot of plugins to integrate into it making it a great choice for me.

#### Writing Tools

I like variety, so pardon me If I have shared a lot of apps that perform similar tasks. Bear App is an app for crafting and writing anything. It can be used for writing articles, jotting down notes, and also as a todo list app.

_GitHub Pages Website_

[GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) is quite useful when you need to spin up a deployed version of your website for free. With a few steps of setup from your git repository, you have a deployed website. I use this a lot.

**Zapier**

[Rocket](https://rocket.peachs.co/r/near-spy-5459) is a slack-style emoji for your Mac. It works just like the emoji finder in Slack. Enter a colon when you want to use an emoji, type its name, and hit enter again to insert. It’s much more convenient than using Mac’s built-in emoji keyboard.

**Numi**

[Numi](https://numi.io/) is a calculator app for your Mac. This is not just a calculator, I must say, because its features are much more than that. It blew my mind when I discovered I could convert virtually anything with it, i.e convert dollars to naira, my local currency! ?

Meanwhile, there are a whole lot of things that can be done with this app. No wonder it is tagged as an instant collaboration tool for Agile teams.

#### **Conclusion**
