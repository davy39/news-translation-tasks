If you’ve ever wanted to explore a programming language that combines elegance, flexibility, and a rich history of innovation, Lisp is a perfect choice. With over six decades of influence on computer science, Lisp has played a foundational role in shaping programming paradigms like functional programming, code-as-data manipulation, and advanced macro systems. Its influence can be seen in modern programming languages like Python, JavaScript, and Rust, making it a valuable language to learn for understanding the roots of these innovations and for developing a deeper appreciation for programming architecture.

We just published a course on the freeCodeCamp.org YouTube channel that will teach you all about Lisp and its enduring relevance. This beginner-friendly course introduces you to Common Lisp, one of the most popular dialects of Lisp. Through hands-on tutorials, you’ll learn to use Lisp’s powerful REPL (Read-Eval-Print Loop), work with lists, master macros, and explore advanced topics like closures, tail recursion, memory management, and object-oriented programming using CLOS (Common Lisp Object System).

Alberto Lerda teaches this course. He is a DevOps engineer who loves Lisp. This course offers a comprehensive foundation for anyone curious about Lisp or seeking to enhance their programming skills with timeless concepts.

### What You'll Learn in This Course

The course begins with the basics of installing Common Lisp and interacting with the REPL, a cornerstone of Lisp development that makes experimenting with code intuitive and interactive. From there, you'll dive into core programming constructs like local variables, branching, and looping, enabling you to write more complex programs.

The course then goes into lists, the heart of Lisp’s structure, showing you multiple ways to build and manipulate them. You’ll also get a beginner-friendly introduction to macros, one of Lisp’s most powerful features, and learn how they differ from functions. Advanced topics like package management, avoiding macro name conflicts, and using Lisp's condition system will deepen your understanding of the language.

For those interested in object-oriented programming, the course provides an introduction to inheritance and polymorphism using CLOS, along with the powerful concept of multi-methods. Functional programming enthusiasts will appreciate sections on closures, the loop macro, and even a Haskell-like type system with Coalton.

### Highlights of the Course

* **Hands-on Approach**: Each section walks you through practical examples, helping you learn by doing.
    
* **Comprehensive Topics**: From beginner essentials like variables and loops to advanced features like debugging, memory management, and functional programming.
    
* **Expert Instruction**: Taught by @the-lisper, an experienced educator with a deep understanding of Common Lisp.
    

This course is perfect for developers looking to expand their knowledge of programming paradigms, learn a language with historical significance, or gain unique perspectives on problem-solving and program architecture. With clear explanations and a structured curriculum, you’ll be able to grasp complex topics and apply them to modern development practices.
