Are you ready to embark on a journey to learn one of the most popular programming languages in the world? Introducing Harvard University's CS50P: Introduction to Programming with Python, a comprehensive video course tailored to teach Python programming from scratch. Taught by the renowned Dr. David J. Malan, this course offers a unique and immersive learning experience that will help you develop the skills you need to excel in the world of programming.

We just posted the entire 16-hour course in the freeCodeCamp.org YouTube channel.

Whether you're a beginner who has never written a single line of code or an experienced programmer looking to expand your knowledge, this course is designed to accommodate students of all levels. This Python-focused course offers a deeper dive into web app development, covering essential topics such as database design, scalability, security, and user experience.

The course includes ten different lectures, each carefully designed to guide you through the complexities of Python programming. Here's an overview of the course sections:

1. Lecture 0 - Functions, Variables
2. Lecture 1 - Conditionals
3. Lecture 2 - Loops
4. Lecture 3 - Exceptions
5. Lecture 4 - Libraries
6. Lecture 5 - Unit Tests
7. Lecture 6 - File I/O
8. Lecture 7 - Regular Expressions
9. Lecture 8 - Object-Oriented Programming
10. Lecture 9 - Et Cetera

This course is a standalone Python programming course that complements Harvard's original CS50x course, which focuses on computer science in general, as well as programming with C, SQL, and JavaScript. You can take CS50P before, during, or after completing CS50x. However, if you're interested in an introduction to computer science itself, it is recommended that you take CS50x.

The CS50P course offers an extensive range of hands-on opportunities for practice, with exercises inspired by real-world programming problems. You don't need any specialized software - a web browser is sufficient to get started, or you can write code on your own PC or Mac.

Don't miss this opportunity to learn Python programming from one of the world's leading educational institutions. Watch the full course on [the freeCodeCamp.org YouTube channel](https://youtu.be/nLRL_NcnK-4) (16-hour watch).
