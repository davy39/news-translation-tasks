In this talk, Quincy Larson shares about the history of freeCodeCamp, and how the JAMstack is used for freeCodeCamp.org.

freeCodeCamp started out as a traditional Node/Express web app. But as our nonprofit's community grew, speed and reliability became more important.

This was especially important for learners in countries without reliable internet access. Quincy shows how we used tools like Gatsby.js to turn our interactive coding platform into a JAMstack web app. He'll also demo some of the optimizations that help make freeCodeCamp.org so fast.

You can watch the video on the [the freeCodeCamp.org YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5H7CI3yqPY) (30 minute watch).‌
