We just posted a course on the freeCodeCamp.org YouTube channel that will teach you how to become an AI Researcher.

This course will guide you step-by-step, starting with the foundational mathematics essential for understanding modern AI, before diving into PyTorch fundamentals. You will then learn about the building blocks of AI, from simple neural networks to the complexities of multi-layer architectures. The course ends with an in-depth module on Transformers, the critical technology underpinning today's Large Language Models (LLMs) and generative AI.

Here are the sections in this course:
