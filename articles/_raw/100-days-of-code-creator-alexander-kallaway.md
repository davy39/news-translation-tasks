On today's episode, I interview Alexander Kallaway. Alex is a software engineer who created the #100DaysOfCode challenge.

In addition to talking about the 100DaysOfCode challenge itself - a challenge which, at this point, thousands of people have taken - Alex and I also talk about how he and his wife moved from Russia to Canada to advance their careers, and how he used freeCodeCamp to gain the skills he needed to get his first developer job.

Alex is an incredibly motivated person, and in this interview I delve into how he keeps himself so fired-up day after day.
