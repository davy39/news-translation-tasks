A rational number is any number that can be expressed as a fraction or ratio of two integers.

For example, 3/4, 8.75, 2, and -6 are all considered rational numbers.  
Note that [integers](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/integer-definition/), or "whole numbers", are rational numbers. This is because they can be expressed as fractions.

For example, 2 can be rewritten as 2/1, or 200/100. -6 can be rewritten as -6/1, 6/-1, or -12/2.

Many non-integer, or decimal numbers, are also rational numbers.

For instance, 8.75 can be rewritten as 8 3/4, 875/100, or 1750/200. This also includes repeating decimal numbers like 0.3333333..., which can be rewritten as 1/3.
