Spring Boot 3 is an advanced framework that simplifies the development of new Spring applications through convention over configuration, providing a range of out-of-the-box functionalities for building enterprise-grade applications efficiently.

We just posted a course on the freeCodeCamp.org YouTube channel that will teach you how to develop apps with Spring Boot and Java. Dan Vega developed this course. Dan is a spring developer advocate, course creator, and speaker.

The course is designed to guide beginners through the nuances of web application development using Spring Boot 3, the cornerstone framework for Java applications. It's a blend of theory and practical application, where you start from the grassroots and ascend to creating sophisticated web applications.

## Module Breakdown

Here is a description of each module in this course.

### Module 1: Course Introduction

Dive into the world of Spring Boot 3, starting with an overview of the course structure and objectives. Understand the prerequisites, including Java fundamentals and the necessary development tools like JDK 17+ and your preferred IDE or text editor. This module sets the stage, ensuring you're well-equipped to embark on this learning journey.

### Module 2: Create Your Project

Kickstart your project with a detailed exploration of how to use start.spring.io for project initialization. This module covers the essentials of Java Build Tools, Maven and Gradle, and best practices for organizing your code, including where to place your code files and the importance of avoiding the default package. Learn the nuances of running your application through an IDE or Maven, and get acquainted with Spring Boot DevTools.

### Module 3: REST API

Delve into creating a REST API, where you'll learn to construct a web application that communicates effectively with clients. Explore the various components of Spring, like @Component, Controller, RestController, Service, and Repository, and understand their roles in your application. This module also covers the basics of CRUD operations in an in-memory setting and introduces you to the principles of dependency injection and data validation.

### Module 4: Working with Databases

This module introduces you to integrating and manipulating databases within your Spring Boot application. You'll start with the H2 Database, progressing to more complex interactions using the JDBC Client. Additionally, you'll learn how to elevate your application with Docker Compose and PostgreSQL, ensuring your app can scale and interact with more sophisticated data storage solutions.

### Module 5: Rest Clients

Explore the construction and utilization of REST clients, crucial for enabling your application to communicate with other web services. This module will guide you through setting up and configuring rest clients to interact with external APIs, enhancing the capability and reach of your application.

### Module 6: Testing

Ensure your application's reliability and stability by mastering testing with the Spring Boot Testing Toolkit. This module emphasizes the importance of testing in the development lifecycle, teaching you how to create and implement a comprehensive testing suite to validate your application's functionality and performance.

## Embark on Your Development Journey

This course is more than just a learning experience; it's a gateway to the vast world of web application development, offering you the tools and knowledge to build your own web applications with confidence. Whether you're starting from scratch or looking to refine your skills, this course is designed to provide a structured, engaging, and informative path to mastering Spring Boot 3.
