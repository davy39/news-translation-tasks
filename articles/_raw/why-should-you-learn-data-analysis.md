The opportunity to leverage insights from data has never been greater.

Humans tend to generate a lot of data each day - from heart rates to favorite songs, fitness goals and movie preferences. You find data in each drawer of business. 

Data is no longer restricted to just technological companies. Businesses as diverse as life insurance agencies, hotels, and product management companies are now using data to make better marketing strategies, improve customer experience, understand business trends or just collect insights on user data. 

In the rapidly expanding world of today, it is essential that we analyze the generated data and provide insights for a better-decision making in the business.

[Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/sites/bernardmarr/2018/05/21/how-much-data-do-we-create-every-day-the-mind-blowing-stats-everyone-should-read/#4821ead760ba) says there are 2.5 quintillion bytes of data created each day and I know from some prior random read that only 0.5% of the data being generated is analysed! Now, that is one mind-boggling statistic.

Some say:

> Data is the Future

> Fuel for the 21<sup>st</sup> Century

> Career of Tomorrow

> Driving Force for Businesses

> Data is the new frontier

All of these hold true!

In fact, everything today depends on data; from big multinationals to small businesses. The urge to study and understand trends in the business has never been so in demand.

**Now is the time for Data!**

With the abundance of data being generated today to be precise in zettabytes, the value of data and related skills primarily go up, creating better job opportunities and career options for data analysts. This makes NOW the perfect time to start a journey into the world of big data analytics

### Data Analytics

So, what exactly is Data Analytics? 

Data Analysis concentrates on making insightful conclusions from raw data. Many of the techniques and processes of data analytics have been automated into mechanical processes and algorithms that work over raw data for human consumption.

At its heart, analytics is all about solving problems.

I can write pages of definition on Data Analytics and there are many websites speaking the same. So, without further ado, let's quickly jump to read what makes Data Analysis a good-to-know skill in 2019!

## 5 Reasons to Learn Data Analytics

### **1. Data analytics is now a priority for top organizations**

With increased business competitions, stiffening economics, and business-driven decision making, top organizations have now to turn to [data analytics](https://bigdata-madesimple.com/5-examples-predictive-analytics-travel-industry/) to identify new market opportunities, pockets for improved business, improvement in services and products, comparison to competitors for their business. 

As things stand today, 77% of top organizations consider data analytics a very critical component of their business performance. Business Performance is measured by analytics. What this means is that data professionals in general have a huge influence on company policies, decisions and marketing strategies

### **2. You will be at the core of decision-making in the company**

One of the most sought after job expectations is the power to make decisions. Often, lack of decision-making power makes a job dissatisfying like just another cog in the great corporate wheel. 

However, as a data analytics professional, you are at the core of decision-making for your company. In fact, you will be an integral part of business decisions and future strategies, because you study trends, you provide meaningful insights on future scope of improvement, thus giving you an important role and purpose within the organization.

### **3. You will have various job titles to choose from**

A data analytics professional has a broad range of job titles and fields from which to choose. Since big data is used almost everywhere today, you can choose to be a:

> Metrics and Analytics Specialist

> Data Analyst

> Big Data Engineer

> Operation Analyst

> Sales Analyst

> Financial Analyst

> Marketing Analyst

> Data Analytics Consultant

I personally love Financial Analysis! :P

### 4. Good Pay and More Job Opportunities

Data is the real generous king. More demand and less supply mean that data professionals are valuable.

I cannot stress enough on the amount of opportunities that open with data and its analysis. Companies now concentrate on comprehensively incorporating data analysis in the business cycle. Just as a business cannot create a remarkable brand experience without social media, business performance evaluation is incomplete without data analysis.

### 5. Large number of industries open

Well, it is pretty clear that data analysts are not confined to a couple of industry segments - their contribution spans the entire industry verticals. 

The transition to Data Analysis is smooth. There is no specific domain; data analysts work for everyone. McDonalds to IBM to Walmart to Estee Lauder. So you can work in any domain of your choice. It could be in an industry verticals like finance, manufacturing, information technology, communications, logistics, retail, automobile, and the whole nine yards. This is the reason choosing the right data analytics training can make all the difference.

> "Being able to look at various pieces of data and draw a conclusion is probably the most valuable skill for any employee to have, and surprisingly it's something that's too often missing from otherwise technically advanced employees."

### Ending Notes

The role of a data analyst is one wherein you make a major difference to the organization you work for. It is about taking pride in the fact that you help the business make correct decisions, achieve its true goals, fulfill the mission and vision. 

Data is the holy grail of today’s world. Data has the power to help any company find its true calling, so it is the job of a data analyst to decipher the data to such an extent that rest of the organization’s departments will directly benefit from this true gift of yours.
