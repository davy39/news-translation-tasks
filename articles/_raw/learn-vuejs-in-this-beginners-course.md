If you’ve been meaning to add Vue.js to your front-end toolbelt, today’s your day. We just published a full, 6-hour Vue 3 course on the [freeCodeCamp.org](http://freeCodeCamp.org) YouTube channel. Instructor Bhrugen Patel walks you through everything you need to build modern, production-ready Vue apps, from the very first `{{ mustache }}` to scalable state management with Pinia.

## Why Vue.js?

Vue stands out in the frontend landscape for several compelling reasons. Its gentle learning curve makes it accessible for beginners while offering depth for experts. As a progressive framework, you can adopt Vue incrementally - use just the view layer or leverage the full ecosystem. Vue delivers exceptional performance with its lightweight virtual DOM implementation and minimal overhead. Vue 3's composition API provides fine-grained reactivity that's both powerful and intuitive. The framework works equally well for small widgets or enterprise-scale applications. Vue offers robust tooling with Vue CLI, DevTools, and official libraries for routing and state management. You'll benefit from active development, regular updates, and extensive third-party resources from the vibrant community.

## Course Overview

Bhrugen guides you through Vue's powerful ecosystem, covering essential concepts like reactivity, directives, and component architecture before advancing to routing, API integration, and state management with Pinia.

The curriculum progresses logically through Vue Fundamentals with core concepts and setup, Reactivity for understanding Vue's responsive data system, Directives & Styling for manipulating the DOM declaratively, and Events & Data Binding for creating interactive interfaces. You'll learn about Forms for building and validating user inputs, Component Architecture for creating reusable UI elements, and Component Communication using props, events, and advanced patterns.

The course covers Provide/Inject for dependency injection across components, Slots & Lifecycle Hooks for template composition and timing control, Routing for single-page application navigation, API Integration for connecting to backend services, and State Management with Pinia for global state.
