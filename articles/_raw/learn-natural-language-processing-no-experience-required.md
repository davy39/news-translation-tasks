We just released a Practical Introduction to Natural Language Processing (NLP) course on freeCodeCamp's YouTube channel.

This course from Dr. Phil Tabor will  take you from having zero knowledge of machine learning to writing an artificial intelligence that can compose Shakespearean prose.

Dr. Tabor will teach you how to use a combination of embedding layers, recurrent neural networks, and fully connected layers to perform classifications. 

You will learn how this can all be done using Python and the TensorFlow 2.0 library.

With enough training data and labels, a natural language processing algorithm can be used to determine bad and good movie reviews, finding toxic comics, identifying fake product reviews, and more.

Here's the course structure:

* Getting Started with Word Embeddings
* How to Perform Sentiment Analysis on Movie Reviews 
* Writing An AI That Writes Shakespeare

At first, words are almost impossible for a computer to meaningfully parse. 

In this course you will learn how to use natural language processing techniques to transform these strings into vectors in a higher dimensional space.

Different words are represented as vectors of different lengths and directions in this space, and this allows the algorithm to find relationships between words by finding the component of one vector along another.

Watch the full course [on the freeCodeCamp.org YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2q5cRJvqI8) (1.5 hour watch).
