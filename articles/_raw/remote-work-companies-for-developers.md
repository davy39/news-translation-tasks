Finding a remote job as a developer can be tricky. You want to work for a company that recognizes the value of remote workers, and you want to be sure that the company will support and encourage your remote working style. 

If you’re a developer looking for an opportunity to work from home, only a handful of jobs can really provide you with great flexibility, a supportive environment, and manageable workloads. 

If you're reading this, you probably want a nice list of companies that offer remote work. Unfortunately, most of the lists out there tend to be outdated or are filled with jobs that are not 100% remote. 

With that in mind, in this article you will find a list of actual companies that hire remote developers in one way or another. You will also learn what these companies do and how they stack up against each other.

## What Are the Benefits of Working Remotely?

Working remotely is an increasingly popular trend. It offers a level of flexibility, autonomy, and freedom not found in other work situations. In addition to that, remote work can also open the door to increased productivity and creativity.

Nicholas Bloom [conducted an experiment](https://hbr.org/2014/01/to-raise-productivity-let-more-employees-work-from-home) and found that remote workers worked 9.5 % longer and were 13% more productive than their in-office counterparts. Below, I'll share some of the benefits of working remotely.

### 1. Working remotely saves time

Employees who work remotely **don’t have to spend time commuting** to work, and can thus manage their own schedule. 

Also, some people perform better at different times of the day. For example, one person may be a morning person, while another is more productive in the evenings. 

As long as you meet deadlines, it doesn’t matter what time of day you do your work.

### 2. You have peace and quiet when working remotely

Offices can be noisy, distracting, and generally disruptive. Sure, they can be productive spaces, but they're often anything but quiet. 

Remote work allows you to escape the daily grind and go to a **quiet location where you can concentrate** on work.

Whether you choose to work from home or not, having peace and quiet during the working day can be the key to greater productivity, more motivation, and less stress.

### 3. Remote work can bring health and happiness

If you commute every day and work in an office, you might not be living as healthily as you could be. Remote developers are often **happier, healthier and much more productive**. 

A recent report entitled the "[State of Remote Engineering](https://terminal.io/state-of-remote-engineering)" captured sentiments from software developers across a range of topics, including remote work, compensation, burnout, payout, and productivity. 

A whopping **75%** of the developers surveyed mentioned they want to work remotely at least three days a week.

The study found that **68%** of respondents are able to get more meaningful work done when working remotely or from home. In contrast, only **32%** reported they are more productive in an office environment. 

Important reasons for this were that working remotely gives people the freedom to make their own decisions and to be responsible for those decisions.

### 4. Remote work can help give you work-life balance

The key to a good work-life balance is to structure your day effectively and make sure you are spending enough time on both your work and home tasks. 

Developers who feel like they have a **sense of achievement are more productive**. Other benefits include:

1. Taking a break when you need one.
2. Spending more time with family.
3. Not rushing to catch a train or spending time sitting in traffic.

### 5. Working remotely lets you personalise your office

The freedom to work remotely allows you not only to work when you want, how you want, and wherever you want. It provides you with the ability to **establish your own office space and personalise it** however you like.

You can create a truly inspirational workspace with the help of your favourite photos, paintings, plants, or anything else you might find that brings you joy. 

This is all about making your work area totally yours – a completely inspiring environment. No one can judge what you like or dislike.
