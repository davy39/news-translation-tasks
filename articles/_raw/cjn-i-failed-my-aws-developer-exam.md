I have just taken the [AWS Certified Developer - Associate Exam](https://aws.amazon.com/certification/certified-developer-associate/) on July 1st of 2019. The result? I failed.

_My AWS Developer Certificate score card_

**_The AWS Certified Developer - Associate (DVA-C01) has a scaled score between 100 and 1,000. The minimum scaled score needed to pass the exam is 720._**

> I got 642

The total number of questions was 65. I did some rough calculations. With 5 more correct answers, I would've passed the exam.

**Recap and reflection**

* When I was taking the exam and gone over the questions, I already felt I was not going to pass. I review my questions. Nothing. 
* What did I do next? I used the erasable paper provided by the testing center to write down the topic of each question.
* What did I find? There were a lot of scenario-based questions, I was expected that. Question using a combination of AWS services, I also expected that. But throttling, troubleshooting, and root cause analysis? Not so much. There were no simple questions. Nothing about SQS (Simple Queue Service), SNS (Simple Notification Service). Also, no computational questions for WCU (Write Capacity Unit) and RCU (Read Capacity Unit) on DynamoDB, which I'm also prepared for.
* What did I feel? I must've gotten unlucky with the question pool and maybe I need more time to do more real hands-on experience in using AWS services and encounter problems.

## What now? 

Did I regret taking the exam? No. I learned a **LOT** during the process.

I'm still optimistic as usual and here's my Jedi Mind Trick:

Failure makes me work hard and be more humble (_makes me think I'm a human being after all_)_._

Accomplishments (_as much I love them_) can make you complacent if you are not mindful.

**Conclusion**

As of writing this blog, I'm moving on to other stuff for now.

My current job as graduate teaching assistant in City University of Seattle, requires me to focus on TypeScript and create content.

We are also preparing to teach Amazon apprentices and it requires us to study up Linux system administration, networking, web development, MEAN stack, and Django to able to support them.

As an Auth0 Ambassador, I need to get up to speed with identity and security. Awesome material from Auth0 [here](https://auth0.com/docs/videos/learn-identity/01-introduction-to-identity).

As an open-source contributor, I need to refactor my code and create a new pull request in the [hackathon-starter](https://github.com/sahat/hackathon-starter) repository.
