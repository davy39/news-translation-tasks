If you are a frequent computer user like I am, your fingers spend a lot of time on a keyboard. And in this article, I'll show you some helpful keyboard shortcuts that will make you you more productive.

## What are Keyboard Shortcuts?

Keyboard shortcuts can save you a lot of time, and they are often used in modern operating systems and computer software packages. You can use them simply by invoking commands and a few keystrokes. This saves you from having to use mouse alone to access menu items and so on. 

Here is a list of the most commonly used keyboard shortcuts – and I've also included a few lesser-known ones.

Even though some of these shortcuts work on Mac, the keyboard layout for Mac is a bit different. So I'll focus  on the correct key combinations for a Windows computer.

## Let's get started
First lets begin with the functional keys so we can see their roles:

### Functional Key Shortcuts

|  F3 | Search for file or folder   |
|  F4 | Display the address bar list in file explorer  |
|  F5 | Refresh the active window   |
|  F6 | Cycle through screen elements in a window   |
|  F10 | Activate the Menu bar in the current app   |
|  F12 | Save as (in a Word document)   |

The above listed shortcuts will work on any Windows computer, no matter the program you have open. There are other shortcuts that will work on specific programs like MS Word, Excel, and so on – but those are for another article.

### Microsoft Excel keyboard shortcuts:  
Most of the key functions between MS Word and Excel are similar. So to avoid repetition of the same function keys, I will only list the ones which are not shared between the two applications:

|  F2 | Edit selected cell   |
|  F5 | Go to a specific cell   |

|  Alt + = | Create the formula to sum all of the above cells   |
|  Ctrl + Shift + ! | Format number in comma format   |
|  Ctrl + Shift + $ | Format number in currency format  |
|  Ctrl + Shift + # | Format number in date format   |
|  Alt+H/B | Add borders   |


The above listed keys are just a few of the most commonly used combinations. Hopefully from that list you will be able to figure out a new helpful shortcut which you didn't already know. 

The list is quite long and I appreciate you reading through it.
