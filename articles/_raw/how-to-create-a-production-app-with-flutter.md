Flutter is a UI toolkit from Google that makes it easier to create natively compiled applications for mobile, web, and desktop from a single code base.

We released a one-hour Flutter crash course that will teach you how to build a well-planned and fully tested Flutter app from scratch. The course will guide you through planning, building, and testing the app.

This course was developed by Tadas Petra from the Amateur Coder channel. He specifically created this course to teach complete beginners how to build a production-ready app.

Many courses just show how to code a program but skip the planning and testing phases. These phases are just as important as coding the program and you will learn how to do them in this course.

This course covers:

* Planning
* Building the App
* Unit Testing
* Widget Testing
* Integration Testing
* Maintainability

Watch the course on the [freeCodeCamp.org YouTube channel](https://youtu.be/aiTTClKJbnw) (1-hour watch).
