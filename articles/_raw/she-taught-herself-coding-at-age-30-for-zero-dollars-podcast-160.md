On this week's episode of the podcast, I interview Julia Undeutsch who is a self-taught software engineer and accessibility specialist. She works at a big European company making software more accessible for people with disabilities.

Julia taught herself to code in her 30s using freeCodeCamp.

We talk about:

* Julia's coding journey from poker dealer to self-taught software engineer
    
* How she creates tutorials in Japanese
    
* Her passion for making software easier to use for everyone
    
* Working remotely at a big European software consultancy
    

You can watch the interview on YouTube:
