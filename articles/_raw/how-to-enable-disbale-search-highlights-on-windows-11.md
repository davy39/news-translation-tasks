Windows 11 is the new operating system from Microsoft. If you've been using it from the beginning after it was just released, then you've already seen some changes.

Search highlights are not new for the Windows operating systems as Windows 10 also has the same feature. And you might want to remove that feature (Don't ask me why! Everyone has their choices... 😅).

Enabling and disabling the search highlights on Windows 10 is pretty straightforward. But the same thing can't be said for Windows 11. 

So, I am writing this article to help you out! I have also created an in-depth video to show you all the processes step by step. Make sure to check that out if you prefer video tutorials.

### 🎥 You can watch this short video to see how it works:

Now, let's start the process!

## How to Disable Search Highlights on Windows 11

Firstly, click on the start button where your windows logo is 🪟.   
Then click on the search box once.
