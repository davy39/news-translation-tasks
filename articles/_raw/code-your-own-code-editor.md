Can you code a code editor in a code editor that you coded?

We just published a new course on the [freeCodeCamp.org](http://freeCodeCamp.org) YouTube channel where you’ll learn how to build your own browser-based code editor.

In this tutorial, developer Mohammed Al Abrah walks you through creating a simple editor that runs entirely on one HTML page. You’ll build tabs for HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and set up an instant live preview so you can see your code in action right away.

The course also covers handy features like keyboard shortcuts, JavaScript validation, and save/load functionality with JSON and local storage. You’ll even add accessibility improvements like focus management and full keyboard navigation.

By the end, you’ll have your own lightweight editor that you can use for practice, teaching, or small projects.

Watch the full course [on the freeCodeCamp.org YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vs4hQsDpxww) (4-hour watch).
