Arkanoid (similar to Breakout) is a classic video game. What better way to improve your TypeScript skills than building a fun game?

_This is the game you will build._

We've released a course on the freeCodeCamp.org YouTube channel that will teach you how to build a browser-based Arkanoid game using TypeScript.

Thomas Weibenfalk developed this course. Thomas is an experienced programmer and teacher.

You will learn to build the game without any frameworks. The game is implemented using types, classes, modules, and modern code in Typescript.

Additionally, you will learn how to use the Parcel bundler. Code bundlers will combine and simplify your code, making it load quicker. Parcel makes it easier to develop in JavaScript and TypeScript.

Watch the full course on the [freeCodeCamp.org YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7bejSTim38A) (95 minute watch).
