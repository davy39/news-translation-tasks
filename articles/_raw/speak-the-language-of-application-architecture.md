How do you begin to engineer the world's best software application? As you live in an Agile world today, how do you use architecture disciplines like Kruchten 4+1, UML, TOGAF, and Zachman? What do they mean? Where do you start?

In this talk, Brad Beiermann will take you on a journey through the past, present and future disciplines of being a software architect. This talk will equip you with the concepts of continuous design, and what it means to be design driven in today's fast paced development environment. 

You can watch the video on the [the freeCodeCamp.org YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGYGEcdPE2U) (2 hour watch).‌
