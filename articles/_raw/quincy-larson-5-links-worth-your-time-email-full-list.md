This week marks the 5-year anniversary of my "5 links worth your time" emails.

It feels strange to refer to myself in the 3rd person, but that's what everyone seems to call these emails: "Quincy Larson's 5 links worth your time emails."

For the past 5 years, I've sent a weekly email to everyone in the freeCodeCamp community who wanted to receive it.

Over the years, the number of people who get this email has grown from less than 100,000 to now more than 4 million people.

Despite the vast readership, I've held fast on three self-imposed rules:

* No ads
* No tracking
* No images or file attachments

Just a simple plain-text email with straight forward descriptions of the free learning resources I'm linking to. 

The only changes I've made over the past five years are to go from 3 links to 5 links. And I started including a quote of the week from a prominent developer or computer scientist. But other than that, I've tried to keep things nice and simple.

Open source contributor Sourabh Joshi was kind enough to compile all 200+ of my past emails into a single document. You can browse them here:

If you want to start receiving my "5 links worth your time" email each Friday, you can opt-in when you [create a freeCodeCamp account](https://www.freecodecamp.org/signin). 

And if you already have a freeCodeCamp account, and want to opt in or update your email address, you can do so on [the freeCodeCamp settings page](https://www.freecodecamp.org/settings).
