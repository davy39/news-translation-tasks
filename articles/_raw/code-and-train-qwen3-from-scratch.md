Qwen3 is the cutting-edge series of large language models developed by Alibaba Cloud's Qwen team. The LLM is known for its advanced reasoning, multilingual support, and efficient hybrid "Thinking" and "Non-Thinking" modes.

We just posted a course on the freeCodeCamp.org YouTube channel that will teach you to train Qwen3 from scratch, one line at a time. You'll see gradients flow, models learn, and AI come alive in real-time, gaining raw, unfiltered machine learning mastery.

This comprehensive course will guide you through the details of Qwen3's architecture and implementation. By the end, you'll have an understanding of how these advanced models function. Vuk Rosić developed this course.

Here are the sections in this course:

* Intro & Demo
    
* Qwen 3 Architecture
    
* Prerequisites
    
* Code Setup & Imports
    
* Model Configuration
    
* Qwen 3 Specifics
    
* Training Hyperparameters
    
* Grouped Query Attention Logic
    
* Muon Optimizer Explained
    
* Data Loading & Tokenization
    
* RoPE Positional Embeddings
    
* Self-Attention Code
    
* Feed-Forward & SwiGLU
    
* Building the Final Model
    
* Evaluation & Optimizer Setup
    
* The Training Loop
    
* Running the Training
    
* Inference & Text Generation
    
* Final Results
