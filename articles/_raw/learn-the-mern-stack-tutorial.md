The MERN stack is a popular stack of technologies for building a modern single-page application. In this video course I developed, you will learn the MERN stack by building a full stack exercise tracker application.

You will learn the basics of all the MERN stack technologies including:

* MongoDB: A document-based open source database.
* Express: A web application framework for Node.js.
* React: A JavaScript front-end library for building user interfaces.
* Node.js: JavaScript run-time environment that executes JavaScript code outside of a browser (such as a server).

You will also learn how to host the database in the cloud using MongoDB Atlas.

You can watch the full video course on the [freeCodeCamp.org YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7CqJlxBYj-M) (2 hour watch).
