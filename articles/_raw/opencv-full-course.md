OpenCV is a cross-platform library that can be used to code real-time computer vision applications. It makes it easier to implement image processing, face detection, and object detection.

We've released a full course on the freeCodeCamp.org YouTube channel that will help you get started with OpenCV. You will learn how to use it with the Python programming language.

The course was created by Jason Dsouza. Jason has been teaching about deep learning and Python for many years.

The course starts with the basics such as reading images and video, image transformations, and drawing on images. Then it covers more advanced concepts such as color spaces, edge detection, and thresholding. Towards the end, you'll learn to build a Deep Computer Vision model to detect between the characters in "The Simpsons".

Here are the topics covered in this course:

### Section #1 - Basics

* Reading Images & Video
* Resizing and Rescaling Frames
* Drawing Shapes & Putting Text
* Essential Functions in OpenCV
* Image Transformations
* Contour Detection

### Section #2 - Advanced

* Color Spaces
* Color Channels
* Blurring
* BITWISE operations
* Masking
* Histogram Computation
* Thresholding/Binarizing Images
* Edge Detection

### Section #3 - Faces:

* Face Detection with Haar Cascades
* Face Recognition with OpenCV's built-in recognizer

### Section #4 - Capstone

* Deep Computer Vision
