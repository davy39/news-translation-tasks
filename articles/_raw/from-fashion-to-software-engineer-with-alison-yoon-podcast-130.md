On this week's episode of the podcast, freeCodeCamp founder Quincy Larson interviews Alison Yoon. She's a Software Engineer who started off in fashion design and taught herself to code using freeCodeCamp.

We talk about:

* What it's like to work in fashion. "You're surrounded by exhausted, unhappy people."
    
* How she used freeCodeCamp and the 100DaysOfCode challenge to learn to code and start her software development career
    
* How she learned English and how to work on engineering teams in the UK.
    
* How she's leading the Korean translation effort for the freeCodeCamp community, with 10,000s of people now reading Korean articles each month
    

Can you guess what song I'm playing on my bass during the intro? It's from a 1985 song.
