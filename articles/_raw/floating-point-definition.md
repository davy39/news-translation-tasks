A floating point number, is a positive or negative whole number with a decimal point.

For example, 5.5, 0.25, and -103.342 are all floating point numbers, while 91, and 0 are not.

Floating point numbers get their name from the way the decimal point can "float" to any position necessary.

Due to this, in computer science, floating point numbers are often referred to as floats. Other common types of numbers in computer science are integers, short, and long.

While some programming languages define these different types of numbers, others don't.

For example, in C you need to store the number 18 as an integer (`int`), and 50.3233 as a float (`float`).

But JavaScript treats all numbers as floats behind the scenes, even integers like 122.
