On this week's episode of the podcast, I interview Elliot Arledge. He's a 20-year old computer science student who's created several popular freeCodeCamp courses on LLMs, the Mojo programming language, and GPU programming with CUDA. He joins us from Edmonton, Alberta, Canada.

We talk about:

* Building AI systems from scratch
    
* How Elliot has learned so much so quickly and his methods
    
* How he approaches reading academic papers
    
* His CS degree coursework VS his self-directed learning
    

In the intro I play the 1988 Double Dragon II game soundtrack song "Into the Turf".
