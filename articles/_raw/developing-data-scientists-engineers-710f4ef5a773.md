More than 15,000 people responded to Free Code Camp’s 2016 New Coder Survey, granting researchers (_like me!_) an unprecedented glimpse into how people are learning to code. They released the entire dataset on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/freecodecamp/2016-new-coder-survey-).

#### 646 respondents answered “_Data Scientist/Data Engineer_” to the question: “_Which one of these roles are you most interested in?_”

Here are a few high-level statistics from this data-focused subset, which complements Free Code Camp’s [exploration of new coders in general](https://medium.freecodecamp.com/we-asked-15-000-people-who-they-are-and-how-theyre-learning-to-code-4104e29b2781#.30hlfqj32).

I’ve borrowed the structure of Free Code Camp’s announcement article for ease of comparison. I’ve also included my comments where findings differ notably_._ And a few bonus plots, too!

### **Who participated?**

Of the **646** developing data scientists and data engineers who responded to the survey:

* **25%** are women _(4% more)_
* their median age is **26** years old _(one year younger)_
* they started programming an average of **16** months ago _(5 months earlier)_

### Learner goals and approaches

#### 14 hours each week, on average, are spent learning.

This is one hour less than new coders in general.

#### 0% want to freelance or start their own business.*

Compared to 40% for the full new coder survey, this is a bit shocking. I have a hunch these zero counts are caused by the [survey’s design](https://medium.freecodecamp.com/we-just-launched-the-biggest-ever-survey-of-people-learning-to-code-cac81dadf1ea#.4q6h3rxv9). Every respondent that answered the job role of interest question has zero counts for “start your own business” and “freelance.”

![Image](https://cdn-media-1.freecodecamp.org/images/fn5pgq2f5k5OU-SVhUFrk7zrHeLxHE26sSHx)

#### 52% percent are already applying for jobs, or will start applying within the next year.

This is a longer time horizon than new coders in general, where 65% are applying within the next year.

![Image](https://cdn-media-1.freecodecamp.org/images/lNbc5oDeKUphgmODGzeQ5zfcslFo0ZUMPuJp)

#### Most of them want to work in an office, as opposed to remotely.

![Image](https://cdn-media-1.freecodecamp.org/images/qty6xgABTJcT5RIh98W4wLdH2wOkm3YBj2tl)

#### And a majority are willing to relocate.

![Image](https://cdn-media-1.freecodecamp.org/images/Nn38UlZlL97LDm6DUuoKkjQfiodnr2evIxPT)

#### Most of them have not yet attended any in-person coding events.

![Image](https://cdn-media-1.freecodecamp.org/images/WDtWs38OYgY97GvARwPY3G6Ksg4QXLP42uqO)

#### 64% have used at least one of Coursera, edX, or Udacity.

Only 46% of new coders in general have used at least one of these resources. These companies have a wider range of subject areas than the some of the coding-specific resources listed.

![Image](https://cdn-media-1.freecodecamp.org/images/D9vPPj0NgJf-s5EKv9QcAy6EAbq-TeGMDUsw)

#### Less than 20% listen to coding-related podcasts.

Of them, [Partially Derivative](http://partiallyderivative.com/), [Becoming A Data Scientist](http://www.becomingadatascientist.com/), and [Talking Machines](http://www.thetalkingmachines.com/) are the only data-specific podcasts noted.

![Image](https://cdn-media-1.freecodecamp.org/images/8lNnDuvT9nxwQQqLugDLFNKNB3v9Ms11Fupe)

#### Only 1% have attended a bootcamp.

6% of new coders have attended a bootcamp.

![Image](https://cdn-media-1.freecodecamp.org/images/aNx6QetGSui6lZ7PBWc66CCdOMG7vx9UkuMS)

### Demographics and Socioeconomics

#### Data-focused respondents represent 166 countries.

![Image](https://cdn-media-1.freecodecamp.org/images/y7ssqsEHvsZdfLnmwi3oW8RsLiCDo-mJVlJx)

#### More than 90% are from North America, Europe, and Asia.

The dominating percentage of North Americans should be expected because Free Code Camp is based in the United States.

![Image](https://cdn-media-1.freecodecamp.org/images/EHY-6w51hkd5a9FfoFeuwjm6aCc0evgoewq6)

#### Their cities span a wide range of urbanization levels.

![Image](https://cdn-media-1.freecodecamp.org/images/OdSqGAg9oTZ9cIr1VubhZLA6JLmfeELS4vNl)

#### Just under a quarter of respondents are ethnic minorities in their country.

![Image](https://cdn-media-1.freecodecamp.org/images/rY7yTMjq-1uoQA8xVz8TpOi2T3iYdDpYChT6)

#### And nearly half are non-native English speakers. They grew up speaking one of 148 languages.

![Image](https://cdn-media-1.freecodecamp.org/images/yac-b3DhH0fzQCc-hmijeLdiTMjQvBkTMzW-)

#### 67% have earned at least a bachelor’s degree.

Compared to 58% for new coders in general, the data-focused subset is more skewed towards post-secondary studies.

![Image](https://cdn-media-1.freecodecamp.org/images/JsSTsedH1YnQHRJt81fgg7BQ0HRM95UrvoN8)

#### They studied 425 different majors. Computer Science and Mathematics were the two most popular majors, and an additional 16% studied some form of engineering.

Diversity amongst majors is greater compared to the full survey, where Computer Science and Information Technology checked in at #1 and #2 with 17% and 5%, respectively.

![Image](https://cdn-media-1.freecodecamp.org/images/NczZx2Mfzy4bJ5dQ9Zgv6xq2qxo3DD5XWGkz)

#### Just over one-half are currently working.

Two-thirds of the new coder population are currently working.

![Image](https://cdn-media-1.freecodecamp.org/images/vytHHjCO8IF71lPRRCBl9254bExJfz8J9bZr)

#### A quarter work in the tech industry.

There is a higher variety of employment fields compared to the full dataset, where 50% of respondents work in software development and IT.

![Image](https://cdn-media-1.freecodecamp.org/images/FSHSj3-vYAYU0Jq8sA9nqU7CqCxVO8sFbM6M)

#### Median current salary is $44k.

The median current salary for the full dataset is $37k.

![Image](https://cdn-media-1.freecodecamp.org/images/dQS3VVj0e1FoMctj56lfATE-IMNhs0NU2xyh)

#### And they expect to earn a median of $60k with their new data science/engineering skills.

The median for the full survey dataset is $50k. With data science/engineering being [notoriously lucrative](http://www.wired.com/insights/2015/03/data-scientists-earning-salaries/) in 2016, some respondents might be seeking higher wages.

![Image](https://cdn-media-1.freecodecamp.org/images/c0HccBsVxzPPza2XsPII8dMLm-BsKL5ZIxlr)

#### 7% have served in their country’s military.

#### 13% have children, and another 3% financially support an elderly or disabled relative. And one-fifth are doing this without the help of a spouse.

#### 47% consider themselves underemployed (working a job that is below their education level).

This is 5% higher than new coders in general.

#### If they have a home mortgage, they owe an average of $194k.

#### If they have student loans, they owe an average of $37k.

This average is $3k more than the full survey dataset.

#### 14% don’t yet have high-speed internet at home.

#### And 3% are currently receiving disability benefits from their government.

#### These are the people who are learning data science and engineering. Free, self-paced learning resources are definitely important.

### What’s next?

You can find a [more detailed version](https://www.kaggle.com/venturidb/d/freecodecamp/2016-new-coder-survey-/developing-data-scientists-engineers) of this analysis on Kaggle, where I outline my [exploratory data analysis (EDA)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exploratory_data_analysis) process.

Be sure to check out my initial exploration of [Free Code Camp’s dataset](https://medium.freecodecamp.com/we-asked-15-000-people-who-they-are-and-how-theyre-learning-to-code-4104e29b2781#.30hlfqj32), where I dive deeper into the characteristics of new coders:
