In January, I wrote an [article](https://www.classcentral.com/report/cs50-free-certificate/) on Class Central about [CS50, Harvard’s Introduction to Computer Science](https://www.classcentral.com/course/edx-cs50-s-introduction-to-computer-science-442), which offers a free certificate. In this article, I'll go over CS50’s entire 10-course lineup, seven of which also offer a free certificate.

## CS50: The Original Course

CS50 is taught by Harvard Professor [David J. Malan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_J._Malan). Back in 2015, when Class Central contributor Charlie Soliman [reviewed the course](https://www.classcentral.com/report/review-david-malan-cs50-introduction-to-cs/), he said this about Professor Malan:

> At the risk of stating a cliché, his approach to teaching is unlike anything I have seen and can easily be labeled as revolutionary. One can detect the joy and effort he puts into each of his lectures.

Having taken the course myself, I can say that this quote is as relevant today as it was back then. In fact, since the course is updated every year, it’s gotten even better.

_CS50 in Harvard’s Sanders Theater_

Offered at [Harvard since 2007](https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2014/9/18/this-is-cs50/) and on [edX since 2012](https://harvardmagazine.com/2012/11/classroom-in-the-cloud), CS50 has grown to become Harvard’s [largest on-campus course](https://sites.duke.edu/csedpodcast/2019/12/23/episode-1-david-malan/), with 800+ students per term. It's also one of the world’s [highest rated](https://www.classcentral.com/report/top-moocs-2019-edition/) and [most popular](https://www.classcentral.com/report/most-popular-online-courses/) MOOCs ever, with 2M+ learners in total.

And “CS50” has evolved from a code designating a [single course](https://www.classcentral.com/course/edx-cs50-s-introduction-to-computer-science-442) to a brand encompassing [multiple courses](https://www.classcentral.com/report/harvard-cs50-new-courses/) exploring different subjects, targeting different audiences, and stacking into different learning paths.

To make sense of CS50’s offerings, I partly audited each course, I explored their online communities, and I contacted their course staff. I found that Professor Malan often replies to emails himself — a nice touch considering the course has over 100 staff.

## CS50: The Expanded Offering

CS50’s full offering currently comprises ten courses that can be broken down into three levels as shown in the table below. As you can see, seven courses offer a free certificate.

## Basic Course

Currently, CS50 only offers one basic course. It can be seen as an optional on-ramp to CS50’s core courses. If you don’t feel ready for a formal introduction to computer science, this is a good place to start.

### CS50 Understanding Technology — CS50T

![Image](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2020/06/cs50-tech.png)

CS50T is a gentle introduction to the world of computing. It starts at the hardware level and works its way up from there. It explores how the internet works, how websites are created, how security is ensured, and ends with coding basics.

The course is taught by David J. Malan. It involves about 4 hours of study per week over 6 weeks. This course offers the following certificate options:

* [Free certificate](https://cs50.harvard.edu/technology/) via Harvard OpenCourseWare
* [Paid verified certificate](https://www.classcentral.com/course/edx-cs50-s-understanding-technology-10142) via edX
* [Paid transcript and academic credit](https://www.extension.harvard.edu/course-catalog/courses/understanding-technology/15513) via Harvard Extension School

## Core Courses

Currently, CS50 offers four core courses. These include the original CS50 as well as variants geared toward different types of learners. This is where most learners want to start. 

One course should be plenty. But learners that take a variant may want to also take the original CS50 — especially if they plan to continue with a follow-up course.

### CS50 Introduction to Computer Science

![Image](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2020/06/cs50-original.png)

CS50 is Harvard’s computer science introduction. It starts with binary and goes up the ladder of abstraction from machine code to low-level languages to high-level languages. It explores algorithms, data structures, and memory management. And it ends with one of three specialization tracks: web, game, or mobile development.

The course is taught by David J. Malan. It involves about 12 hours of study per week over 12 weeks. And it offers the following certificate options:

* [Free certificate](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x) via Harvard OpenCourseWare
* [Paid verified certificate](https://www.classcentral.com/course/edx-cs50-s-introduction-to-computer-science-442) via edX
* [Paid transcript and academic credit](https://www.extension.harvard.edu/course-catalog/courses/intensive-introduction-to-computer-science/24107) via Harvard Extension School

### CS50 AP Computer Science Principles — CS50AP

![Image](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2020/06/cs50-ap.png)

CS50AP is a CS50 variant that allows students in participating schools to earn AP credit. In the US, AP credit can help university applicants bolster their chances of admission and validate credit. 

The course covers the same content as CS50 but includes more material, two extra assignments, and a proctored exam.

The course is taught by David J. Malan. It involves about 5 hours of study per week over 32 weeks. And it only offers a [paid verified certificate](https://www.classcentral.com/course/edx-cs50-s-ap-computer-science-principles-7017) via edX.

### CS50 Computer Science for Lawyers — CS50L

![Image](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2020/06/cs50-law.png)

CS50L is a CS50 variant geared toward lawyers and law students. Part of the curriculum explores similar content but emphasizes big-picture understanding of low-level details. The other part explores entirely new content that considers how law and computer science interact — for instance, in regards to cybersecurity, data privacy, and internet regulation.

The course is taught by David J. Malan and [Doug Lloyd](https://douglloyd.com/). It involves about 4 hours of study per week over 10 weeks and offers the following certificate options:

* [Free certificate](https://cs50.harvard.edu/law/) via Harvard OpenCourseWare
* [Paid verified certificate](https://www.classcentral.com/course/edx-cs50-for-lawyers-16857) via edX
* [Paid certificate](https://execed.law.harvard.edu/computerscience/) via Harvard Law School Executive Education

### CS50 Computer Science for Business Professionals — CS50B

![Image](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2020/06/cs50-business.png)

CS50B is a CS50 variant geared toward business professionals. Most of the course explores similar content but emphasizes big-picture understanding of low-level details. A small part explores entirely new content relevant to businesses, for instance, cloud computing.

The course is taught by David J. Malan. It involves about 4 hours of study per week over 6 weeks and offers the following certificate options:

* [Free certificate](https://cs50.harvard.edu/business/) via Harvard OpenCourseWare
* [Paid verified certificate](https://www.classcentral.com/course/edx-cs50-s-computer-science-for-business-professionals-10143) via edX
* [Paid certificate and academic credit](https://www.extension.harvard.edu/course-catalog/courses/computer-science-for-business-professionals/25393) via Harvard Extension School

## Follow-up Courses

Currently, CS50 offers five follow-up courses. These pick up where CS50 leaves off and explore a specific subject. They’re an excellent way to build on your computer science fundamentals by delving into a specialization.

### CS50 Introduction to Artificial Intelligence with Python — CS50AI
