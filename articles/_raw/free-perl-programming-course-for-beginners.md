For decades, the Perl programming language has remained important in the realms of text processing, system administration, and even web development.

We just published a full course on the freeCodeCamp.org YouTube channel that will teach you how to use Perl. The course covers topics ranging from basic syntax to advanced topics like object-oriented programming, regular expressions, and web development.

Valters from Perl Tech Stack developed this course. He has been using Perl for years and he will teach you how to use the language in your own projects.

You will understand the core of Perl through a hands-on approach. Learn the essentials, from scripting basics to data manipulation with scalars, arrays, and hashes. Debugging becomes intuitive with the Data::Dumper module, while advanced techniques like references and subroutines empower you to build dynamic and modular code.

You will also navigate real-world scenarios as you learn about object-oriented programming, module usage, and web interaction. Master the art of handling regular expressions, harness built-in functions, and optimize your scripts with special variables. The course ends with practical applications such as web requests, file I/O, and system command execution.

Here is a full list of all the course sections:

* Introduction
* Running Perl via CLI
* Perl Script File Structure
* Data Types - Scalars
* Debugging with Data::Dumper
* Data Types - Arrays
