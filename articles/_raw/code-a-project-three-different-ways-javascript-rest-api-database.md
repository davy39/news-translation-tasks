When you code a similar project using different methods it helps you understand each method more.

We just published a course on the freeCodeCamp.org YouTube channel that will teach you how to code a flight widget in JavaScript using multiple methods.

First you will learn to create the project using JavaScript beginner approach. Next, you will learn how to update the project to use a API to get the data for the widget. Finally you will create the project as a React application with a mini-backend using Node.js to communicate with a database hosted in the cloud.

Ania Kubow developed this course. Ania is a popular creator and software developer. She has created many courses for both the freeCodeCamp channel and her own channel.

_You will build this flight widget._

The three sections are as follows:

* Flight widget in pure JavaScript
* Flight widget in JavaScript and Node.js using a REST API
* Flight widget in React and Node.js using a Database
