In this week's episode of the podcast, I interview Robby Russell. Robby created the open-source project Oh My ZSH. 

Oh My Zsh is a framework for managing your Zsh configuration for your command line terminal. It's been extremely popular among developers for more than a decade.

Robby is also the CEO of [Planet Argon](https://www.planetargon.com/), a developer consultancy he created two decades ago. He's done work for Nike and lots of other companies.
