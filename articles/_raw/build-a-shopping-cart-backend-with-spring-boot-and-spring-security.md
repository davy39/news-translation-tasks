We just posted a course on the freeCodeCamp.org YouTube channel that is designed to help you master Spring Boot and Spring Security by guiding you through the development of a fully functional shopping cart backend application. Samson Alfred created this course.

### **Course Overview**

This course is perfect for developers looking to deepen their understanding of Spring Boot and Spring Security. You'll start from scratch, generating a new project, and progress through creating and mapping entity classes, implementing CRUD operations, and developing services and controllers for products, categories, and carts. By the end of the course, you'll have a robust backend application and a solid grasp of key Spring technologies.

Here are the key technologies featured int his coruse.

**Spring Boot**: Spring Boot is a powerful framework that simplifies the process of building production-ready applications. It provides a range of features, including auto-configuration and an embedded server, which help streamline the development process. In this course, you'll learn how to leverage Spring Boot to quickly set up and manage your shopping cart backend.

**Spring Security**: Security is a critical aspect of any application, and Spring Security is a comprehensive framework that addresses authentication and authorization concerns. You'll learn how to integrate Spring Security into your project, ensuring that your application is protected against common security threats.

**JWT (JSON Web Tokens)**: JWT is a compact, URL-safe means of representing claims to be transferred between two parties. In this course, you'll discover how to use JWT for secure user authentication, allowing your application to verify user identities and manage sessions effectively.
