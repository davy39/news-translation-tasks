More and more applications are using computer vision these days.

We just published a full course on the freeCodeCamp.org YouTube channel that will help you learn advanced computer vision using Python. You will learn state of the art computer vision techniques by building five projects with libraries such as OpenCV and Mediapipe.

If you are a beginner, don't be afraid of the term advance. Even though the concepts are advanced, the course teaches them in a way that is easy to follow. 

This course is taught by Murtaza Hassan. Murtaza has a popular YouTube channel about Robotics and AI and now he is sharing his expertise with the freeCodeCamp audience.

In the first half of the course you will learn core techniques by implementing hand tracking, pose estimation, face detection, and face mesh. 

In the second half of the course you will create five projects with real-word application. Here is what you will create:

* Gesture Volume Control
* Finger Counter
* AI Personal Trainer
* AI Virtual Painter
* AI Virtual Mouse

Watch the full course below or on [the freeCodeCamp.org YouTube channel](https://youtu.be/01sAkU_NvOY) (6-hour watch).
