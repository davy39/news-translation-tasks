MCP is the standard rule set that allows AI agents, like GitHub Copilot and Gemini, to securely and intelligently interact with your databases, functions, and applications.

We just published a course on the freeCodeCamp.org YouTube channel that will teach you how to create Model-Context Protocol (or MCP) servers using the open source FastMCP Python library. Carlos Leon created this course.  
  
You'll learn what MCP is and why it matters. Then you'll dive into three hands-on coding projects.  
  
You'll build calculator apps using Standard I/O (STIO) and HTTP Stream, integrate APIs for dynamic content, and apply testing with GitHub Copilot.  
  
You’ll finish by deploying your MCP on FastMCP Cloud for a complete end-to-end workflow.

Here are the sections in the course:

* About MCP
    
* Coding Scenario 1
    
* Coding Scenario 2
    
* Coding Scenario 3
    
* Testing MCPs with Github Copilot
    
* Bonus: Deploying a MCP on FastMCP Cloud
    

Watch the full course on [the freeCodeCamp.org YouTube channel](https://youtu.be/DosHnyq78xY) (1-hour watch).
