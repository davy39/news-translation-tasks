2025 has been an amazing year for the global freeCodeCamp community. And we’re thrilled to cap it off with the launch of several Christmas Gifts for you:

1. freeCodeCamp's Python certification
    
2. freeCodeCamp's JavaScript certification (Version 10)
    
3. freeCodeCamp's Responsive Web Design Certification (Version 10)
    
4. freeCodeCamp's Relational Database + SQL Certification
    
5. Our A2 level English for Developers Certification
    
6. Our B1 level English for Developers Certification
    
7. Our beta A1 level Spanish curriculum
    
8. Our beta A1 level Mandarin Chinese curriculum
    

Those are a lot of gifts to unwrap, so let's start unwrapping!

## Programming Certifications and Version 10 of the Full Stack Development Curriculum

Over the past 11 years, the freeCodeCamp community has built and rebuilt our core programming curriculum several times.

We are finally approaching our vision of how comprehensive and interactive a programming curriculum can be.

Version 10 of our curriculum is a series of 6 certifications – each with more than a dozen projects that you'll build to solidify your fundamental skills.

At the end of each certification, you'll take a final exam. And if you can manage to pass this exam, you'll be awarded a free, verified certification. You can then embed that on LinkedIn, or add it to your résumé, CV, or portfolio website.

So far, 4 of these certifications are now live:

* [Responsive Web Design certification announcement](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/freecodecamps-new-responsive-web-design-certification-is-now-live/)
    
* [JavaScript certification announcement](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/freecodecamps-new-javascript-certification-is-now-live/)
    
* [Python certification announcement](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/freecodecamps-new-python-certification-is-now-live/)
    
* [Relational Databases certification announcement](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/freecodecamps-new-relational-databases-certification-is-now-live/)
    

And we will release the Front End Libraries and Back End Development certifications in 2026.

After earning all 6 certifications, you can build a final capstone project – which will be code-reviewed by an experienced developer. Then you’ll sit for a comprehensive final exam. And upon completion of that, you'll earn our final Full Stack Developer Certification.

If you start progressing through these first four certifications today, the last two certifications should go live well before you reach them. After all, each of them represents hundreds of hours of conceptual computer science knowledge and hand-on programming practice.

## Language Coursework

First, you may be asking: when did freeCodeCamp start teaching world languages?

Well, we started designing our English for Developers curriculum back in 2022. And over the past few years, we've expanded it considerably.

The curriculum involves interacting with hand-drawn animated characters. Along the way, you get tons of practice with reading, writing, listening, and (coming in 2026) speaking.

![A chart of the 6 CEFR levels for language learning](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1766527685142/e1cc58c5-a245-4777-b2cf-b97dd7790d27.webp align="center")

It's a story-driven curriculum. You step into the shoes of a developer who's just arrived in California to work at a tech startup. You learn grammar, vocab, tech jargon, and slang through day-to-day interactions while living your new life.

So far, two of these certifications are fully live:

* [A2 Level English certification announcement](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/freecodecamps-a2-english-for-developers-certification-is-now-live/)
    
* [B1 Level English certification announcement](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/freecodecamps-b1-english-for-developers-certification-is-now-live/)
    

We're also developing levels A1, B2, C1, and C2 for release over the coming years. (Yes, years. Each of these is a huge undertaking to develop.)

Not only has the freeCodeCamp community designed thousands of English lessons - we also built tons of custom software tools to make all this coursework possible. So in 2024, we asked: could we use the same tools to teach people Spanish and Mandarin Chinese?

And today, the results of this effort are now in public beta. We're starting out with A1 Level for both of these languages, and will ship the remaining levels over the coming years.

* [A1 Level Mandarin Chinese curriculum announcement](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/freecodecamps-a1-professional-chinese-curriculum-beta-is-now-live/)
    

## Why Teach Spanish and Mandarin?

Aside from English, Spanish and Mandarin are two of the most widely-spoken languages in the world. You can use these languages to participate in tons of online communities, visit major cities, and even find new job opportunities.

Learning foreign languages is also excellent for your neuroplasticity, and can be done alongside learning other new skills like programming.

And now you can learn these languages for free, using our comprehensive end-to-end curriculum that was designed by teachers, translators, and native speakers.

## Update on Translating freeCodeCamp’s coursework into major world languages

As you may know, freeCodeCamp has been available in many major world languages going back to 2020. But whenever we launch new coursework, it takes several months to translate everything.

Thankfully, machine translation has been steadily improving over the past few years.

The community is still translating tutorials and books by hand, but for something that changes as quickly as freeCodeCamp’s programming curriculum, we want to speed up the process.

We’ve conducted pilots of translating all the new coursework into both Spanish and Portuguese.

* First, we used frontier Large Language Models and extensive glossaries and style guides to process the hundreds of thousands of words in our programming curriculum.
    
* Then we had native speakers randomly sample these translations to ensure their quality.
    
* Once we felt the translations were strong enough, we started creating data pipelines to automatically update translations as the original English text changed through open source code contributions.
    

The monetary cost of doing all this is not significant. So we should be able to offer freeCodeCamp’s programming curriculum in additional languages we weren’t previously able to support, such as Arabic and French.

![A screenshot of freeCodeCamp's programming curriculum translated into Portuguese](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1766528132885/06da1977-85b8-438e-8e80-1818f3dba7e7.webp align="center")

If you are one of the hundreds of people who’ve contributed translations to freeCodeCamp over the years, we’d still welcome your help translating books and tutorials, which don’t change much after initial publication.

After all, the gold standard for localizing a document is having a single human translator holistically read and understand that document before creating the translation.

## This community is just getting started.

This year the freeCodeCamp community also published:

* 129 free video courses on the freeCodeCamp community YouTube channel
    
* 45 free full length books and handbooks on the freeCodeCamp community publication
    
* 452 programming tutorials and articles on math, programming, and computer science
    
* 50 episodes of the freeCodeCamp podcast where I interview developers, many of whom are contributors to open source freeCodeCamp projects
    

We also merged 4,279 commits to freeCodeCamp’s open source learning platform, representing tons of improvements to user experience and accessibility. And we published our secure exam environment so that campers can take certification exams.

You can view our [2025 list of Top Open Source Contributors](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/freecodecamp-top-open-source-contributors-2025/).

As a community, we are just getting started. Free open source education has never been more relevant than it is today.

## We invite you to get more involved in the community, too.
