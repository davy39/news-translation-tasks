A while ago I started a [thread on Twitter](https://twitter.com/leozera/status/1090639374109138946) with a few terminal tips. There are lots of command line interfaces in NPM and they can be very handy in our daily work. 

Here they are. If you like them, you can [follow me](https://twitter.com/leozera) on twitter for more tips :)
