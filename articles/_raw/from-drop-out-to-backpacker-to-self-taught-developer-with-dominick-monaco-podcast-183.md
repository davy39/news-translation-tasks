On this week's episode of the podcast, freeCodeCamp founder Quincy Larson interviews Dominick Monaco. He dropped out college to hike the Appalachian Trail, a 2,200 mile backpacking route across the US. After working in nature conservation for 3 years, he taught himself how to program and now works as a developer.

We talk about:

* Life working as a Yogi Bear-style forest ranger in training
    
* Close brushes with death in the wilderness and how it affects you
    
* Learning programming for a grand total of $15
    
* How surrounding yourself with other ambitious learners can help you learn programming faster
