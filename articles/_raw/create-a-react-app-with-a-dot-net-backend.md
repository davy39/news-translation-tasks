ASP.NET Core can work well as a backend for your React apps.

We just published a course on the freeCodeCamp.org YouTube channel that will teach you how to to create a basic React application that leverages a .NET Web API Component written in C#.

In order to integrate React with a .NET Web API component this course utilizes the 'ASP.NET Core with React.js' project template from within the free version of Visual Studio 2022 (the community edition). The App that you will build enables users to rank items by dragging and dropping the items (displayed in a list) to a cell position on the ranking grid (the grid is positioned above the list of relevant items).

Each cell position on the grid denotes a ranking value. For example, the top left cell is position number 1 denoting the top ranked item and the cell positioned to the immediate right of this cell denotes the 2nd ranked item. This continues all the way to the bottom right cell which is the worst possible ranking position.

Coding this project will give you an insight into how to build a simple app using React on the front-end that leverages a .NET Web API component on the backend.

Gavin Lon created this course. He is an experienced software developer and teacher.
