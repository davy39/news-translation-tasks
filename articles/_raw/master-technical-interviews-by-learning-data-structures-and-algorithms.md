Learn how to master technical interviews for software engineering roles.

We just posted a 49-hour course on the freeCodeCamp.org YouTube channel that will teach you everything you need to know about data structures and algorithms. Parth Vyas created this course.

Technical interviews often hinge on your ability to confidently solve problems using data structures and algorithms (DSA), which can feel challenging without the right foundation. In this comprehensive course, Parth will strip away the intimidation and equip you with the essential knowledge, starting with the core concepts of data structures, algorithms, and fundamental analysis like time and space complexity.

You'll learn how to judge an algorithm's efficiency using Big O notation and apply this important skill to code blocks. The course covers almost every major data structure and algorithm pattern, from Arrays, Linked Lists, Stacks, and Queues to advanced topics like Trees, Graphs, Dynamic Programming, and Backtracking.

Here are the sections in this course:

* Technical interviews 101
