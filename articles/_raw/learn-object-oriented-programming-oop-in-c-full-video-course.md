Object Oriented Programming (OOP) is commonly used when writing code with C++. It is a concept used in many other programming languages as well and it is important for all programmers to understand.

Object Oriented Programming is a programming paradigm that uses the concepts of objects and classes. It is a standard in programming that is used to solve a specific type of problem. OOP is a way to structure a program using reusable pieces of code (called classes) which can be used to create individual instances of objects.

We have released a full course on the freeCodeCamp.org YouTube channel that will teach you all about Object Oriented Programming and how to implement the concepts using C++.

This course was developed by Saldina Nurak, who is known on YouTube as CodeBeauty. Saldina is an experienced C++ software engineer who has created many C++ courses.

First, you will learn the basics of Object Oriented programming. Then, you will learn advanced OOP concepts and how to implement them using C++ code.

Here are the topics covered in this course:

* Introduction to OOP
* Classes and objects
* Access modifiers
* Constructors
* Encapsulation
* Abstraction
* Inheritance
* Polymorphism
* Outro
* Bloopers

Watch the full course on [the freeCodeCamp.org YouTube channel](https://youtu.be/wN0x9eZLix4) (90 minute watch).
