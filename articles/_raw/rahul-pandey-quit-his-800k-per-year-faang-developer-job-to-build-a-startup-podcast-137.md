On this week's episode of the podcast, freeCodeCamp founder Quincy Larson interviews Rahul Pandey. He's a software engineer who left his $800K / year FAANG job to build his own startup.

We talk about:

* The post-layoff developer job landscape
    
* Developer interviews and how to differentiate yourself
    
* Why salary negotiation still makes sense
    
* His belief that 10x engineers exist – and even 100x and 1000x
    

Can you guess what song I'm playing on my bass during the intro? It's from a 1969 Motown classic.
