I believe that one of the best ways to improve your coding skills is to CODE MORE!

For that I have the perfect challenge for you! ?

It's called: **#7Days7Websites**

The main rule is simple: build one website, every day, for a week.

Here is a short video I made to explain everything in more detail:

You can find the official website [here](https://7days7websites.glitch.me/).

## Rules

* Create a website every day for a week.
* You can use any programming language and/or any framework you want.
* The website can be on any topic.
* Submit your entries on the [submit](https://7days7websites.glitch.me/submit) page.
* Share your progress on Social Media using the **#7Days7Websites** hashtag.

## Live Streams

I'm also going to attempt this challenge in a series of Live Streams on my [YouTube Channel](https://youtube.com/florinpop). Subscribe if you want to get notified when I go live.

## Suggestions

Anyone is free to build anything they want, but if you don't have an idea or you want some inspiration, here are some of the websites that could help:

* [Frontend Mentor](https://frontendmentor.io/?ref=florinpop)
* [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/)
* [App Ideas Repository](https://github.com/florinpop17/app-ideas)

## Showcase

At the end of these 7 days I'm going to make a **Special** Live Stream where I'm going to showcase the best submissions.

## Conclusion

I hope this challenge will get the best out of you and it will help you improve your coding skills! ?

Happy Coding! ?
