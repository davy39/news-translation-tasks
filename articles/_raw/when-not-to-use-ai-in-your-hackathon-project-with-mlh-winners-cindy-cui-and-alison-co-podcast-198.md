Today Quincy Larson interviews Alison Co and Cindy Cui, two university students who won the NW Hacks hackathon with their tool that helps people who are losing their vision learn to read Braille. He met them when GitHub invited them to their big San Francisco conference, GitHub Universe to present their project.

Alison Co is a software engineer who's graduating Fall 2026. She's among the prestigious Major League Hacking Top 50 hackers. She's interned at Hubspot and will soon start interning at Rippling.

Cindy Cui is a software engineer who's graduating Spring 2026. She's interning as a backend developer at Shopify. She also teaches violin and holds the prestigious Level 10 Violin certification from the Royal Conservatory of Music.

We talk about:

* Tips for securing good internships
    
* How they use AI as university students and as devs, and its limits
    
* How they built their winning hackathon project to help people losing their vision learn to read braille

1. freeCodeCamp just published a Discrete Mathematics for beginners course. It'll teach you tons of math concepts that are key to modern Machine Learning. You'll learn some Number Theory and Combinatorics, then use Python to explore the Pigeonhole Principle, the Stars and Bars Principle, Stirling Numbers, the Chinese Remainder Theorem, and more. (9 hour YouTube course): [https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/learn-discrete-mathematics/](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/learn-discrete-mathematics/)
    
2. We also published this JavaScript course on the open source n8n agentic workflow automation tool. freeCodeCamp instructor Gavin Lon will teach you core concepts like working with loops, trigger nodes, webhooks, and more. You can code along at home and build 4 real-world projects, including a chatbot and an emergency notification app. (3 hour YouTube course): [https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/build-complex-workflows-with-n8n-and-master-ai-integration/](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/build-complex-workflows-with-n8n-and-master-ai-integration/)
    
3. Learn the popular Vue.js front end JavaScript framework. You'll learn Vue's core building blocks like components, reactivity, template syntax, dynamic data binding, and asset handling. By the end of the course, you'll have a simple Vue app that you can show to your friends. Also note that I recently interviewed Evan You, the creator of Vue, on the freeCodeCamp podcast.

4. Learn how to run an open source LLM locally on your own hardware using Ollama. This is a great way to unlock the power of LLMs without the privacy and security tradeoffs of using public LLM websites and APIs. This freeCodeCamp guide will walk you through the setup process and give you a feel for the options at your disposal.

5. Learn about the eccentric designer Luigi Colani and his biomorphic designs that imitate nature. This video essay dives into the German designer's life history and his body of work. Why were his designs so broadly disliked by the design establishment? In what ways was he ahead of his time? How did he influence the development of cameras, or design a gas-powered car that got 130 miles to the gallon? I learned a ton from this and you will to. 30 minute watch: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVo7H3EheMY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVo7H3EheMY)
    
6. Today's song of the week is Leon Ware's 1982 classic "Why I Came to California". I love the positive energy of the song, the brass blasts, and the duet vocals. I thought it'd be perfect since I met today's podcast guests in California when they were visiting from Canada.
