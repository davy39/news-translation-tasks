Terraform is an open source infrastructure as code software tool that makes it easy to programmatically to set up infrastructure on a variety of cloud service providers.

We just published a course on the freeCodeCamp.org YouTube channel that will teach you how to use Terraform and AWS to setup a development environment.

Derek Morgan created this course. He has created a bunch of courses to prepare students for a variety of technical certifications.

This course is designed to help you learn the basics of Terraform fast with a hands-on project that can serve as a framework for your own projects!

This project will guide you through Terraform basics as you utilize Visual Studio Code (on Windows, Mac, or Linux) to deploy AWS resources and an EC2 instance that you can SSH into to have your own redeployable environment that you can use for future projects.

Here are the sections covered in this course:

* Welcome and Setup
* What We're Going to Build
* AWS IAM Setup
* Local Environment Setup
* Let's Build!
* AWS Provider and Terraform Init
* A VPC and Terraform Apply
* The Terraform State
* Terraform Destroy
* A Subnet and Referencing
* An IGW and Terraform fmt
* A Route Table
* A Route Table Association
* A Security Group
* An AMI Datasource
* A Key Pair
* An EC2 Instance
* Userdata and the File Function
* SSH Config Scripts
* The Provisioner and Templatefile
* The Deployment and Replace
* Variables
* Variable Precedence
* Conditional Expressions
* Outputs
* Conclusion
