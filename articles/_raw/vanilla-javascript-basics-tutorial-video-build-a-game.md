In this quick JavaScript tutorial, Marina will walk you through building your own memory matching game using vanilla JavaScript (plain JavaScript with no libraries).

She covers the native JavaScript ways to select elements in the DOM, how to iterate through lists with `forEach`, timeouts, and event listeners.

Along the way, Marina will also explain the CSS Box model, and how padding and margins work, as well as absolute VS relative positioning.

You can watch Marina's video on [the freeCodeCamp.org YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZniVgo8U7ek) (34 minute watch).‌
