Creating a full-featured YouTube clone requres a deep understanding of a wide variety of technologies. If you want to gain that understading, we have a course for you.

We just posted a course on the freeCodeCamp.org YouTube channel that will teach you how to use the T3 stack to create a video steaming platform.

In this course, created by the talented Jerome McCree, you'll delve into the T3 Stack, which comprises Next.js, TypeScript, TRPC, Next Auth, Prisma, and Tailwind CSS. By the end of this comprehensive course, you'll have the skills and knowledge to build a complicated end-to-end web application.

First, gain insight into the essential technologies that make up the T3 Stack and how they come together to form a powerful web development toolkit. Understanding the core components of the T3 Stack is crucial, and this section provides an in-depth overview of Next.js, TypeScript, TRPC, Next Auth, Prisma, and Tailwind CSS.

To ensure your app has data to work with, you'll learn how to write Prisma models and seed your database. This fundamental step will lay the foundation for the content you'll be managing.

_You will build this app._

With the backend in place, you'll shift your focus to the frontend. Learn how to integrate and customize Tailwind CSS, create essential components like buttons, a navbar, and a sidebar, and make your application visually appealing.

Building the various pages of your application is a major part of the course. You'll tackle everything from the home page and search functionality to individual video pages and user profiles.

As you progress, you'll add interactivity to your app, including features like follow buttons, like and dislike buttons, video descriptions, comments, and more.

Master the art of user profile management, including creating profile headers, playlist pages, viewing history, and managing announcements.

In the final stretch of the course, you'll delve into creating an admin dashboard with features like publishing, editing, deleting, and uploading videos.

By the time you reach the end of this course, you'll have transformed your knowledge and skills in web development, mastering the T3 Stack and gaining the confidence to tackle complex full-stack projects. 

You can watch the full course on the freeCodeCamp.org YouTube channel (14-hour watch).
