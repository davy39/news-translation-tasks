When working with dictionaries in Python, you’d often run into `KeyError` exceptions.

Dictionaries are built-in data structures of key value pairs. So you can look up a value—in constant time—using the corresponding key like so: `dict[key]` returns `value`. But what if the key doesn't exist in the dictionary? Well, that’s when you get a `KeyError` in Python.

There are few different ways you can handle such `KeyError` exceptions. You can handle them explicitly or use certain dictionary methods to set default values for missing keys. And in this tutorial, we’ll look at the following methods by coding a simple example:

* Using `try-except` blocks
* Using the dictionary method `get()`
* Using `defaultdict` from the `collections` module

Let's get started.

## 1. How to Handle KeyError Exceptions with `try-except` Blocks

Let's start by reviewing when KeyErrors occur and how we can handle these exceptions using `try-except` blocks.

### When Does a KeyError Occur?

In Python, a `KeyError` exception occurs when you try to access the value corresponding to a key that doesn't exist. Consider the following `books` dictionary:

```python
books = {
	"1984": "George Orwell",
	"To Kill a Mockingbird": "Harper Lee",
	"The Great Gatsby": "F. Scott Fitzgerald"
}

```

In the `books` dictionary, the keys are titles of the books and the values are the names of the authors. So you can look up the author of a book using the title as the key.

Now let's try to look up the author of a book that doesn't exist in the dictionary:

```python
print(books["Brave New World"])
```

You’ll run into the following `KeyError` exception:

```
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/home/balapriya/keyerror/main.py", line 7, in <module>
	print(books["Brave New World"])
      	~~~~~^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
KeyError: 'Brave New World'

```

### How to Handle KeyError Exceptions 

You can explicitly handle such `KeyError` exceptions using `try-except` blocks like so:

```python
try:
	value = dictionary[key]
except KeyError:
	value = default_value

```

Here:

* We wrap the block of code that might raise an exception within the try block. In this case, we attempt to access the value associated with the key.
* If a `KeyError` is raised, we handle it in the `except` block by assigning a default value.

For the `books` dictionary example, we have:

```python
books = {
	"1984": "George Orwell",
	"To Kill a Mockingbird": "Harper Lee",
	"The Great Gatsby": "F. Scott Fitzgerald"
}

try:
    # Try to access the key "Brave New World"
	author = books["Brave New World"]  
    # Catch the KeyError if the key does not exist
except KeyError:  
	author = "Book not found"  

print(author) 

```

We try to look up the author of “Brave New World'' again. But this time the `KeyError` triggers the except block, and we get “Book not found”.

```python
Output >>> Book not found

```

## 2. How to Handle KeyErrors Using the `get()` Dictionary Method

Another way to handle missing keys without raising an exception is using the `get()` dictionary method. 

You can use the `get()` method on any valid dictionary object. The `get()` method returns the value for a given key if it exists – otherwise, it returns a specified default value. You can use it like so:

```python
value = dictionary.get(key, default_value)
```

In essence, the `get()` method tries to _get_ the value for the specified key:

* If the key exists, it returns the corresponding value. 
* If the key does not exist, it returns the `default_value`.

Let's now use the `get()` method on the books dictionary. We pass in "Book not found" as the default value in the method call. 

```python
books = {
	"1984": "George Orwell",
	"To Kill a Mockingbird": "Harper Lee",
	"The Great Gatsby": "F. Scott Fitzgerald"
}

# Try to get the value for "Brave New World"
author = books.get("Brave New World", "Book not found")  
print(author)  

```

As expected, you should get the following output:

```python
Output >>> Book not found
```

**Note**: The `get()` method does not modify the original dictionary. If you also want to add the missing key with a default value, you can use the `setdefault()` method instead with the syntax `dictionary.setdefault(key,default_value)`.

## 3. How to Use `defaultdict` from the `collections` Module

A (much) cleaner way to handle KeyErrors is using `defaultdict` from Python’s `collections` module. Defaultdict extends the capabilities of Python's built-in dictionary by allowing you to provide a default value for keys that haven't been explicitly set.

The `defaultdict` constructor takes a default factory function as an argument. This factory function is called _without_ arguments to provide a default value for a non-existent key. 

The syntax for creating a `defaultdict` is as follows:

```python
from collections import defaultdict

# Syntax
defaultdict(default_factory)

```

Let's create a `defaultdict` from the `books` dictionary as shown:

```python
from collections import defaultdict

books = {
	"1984": "George Orwell",
	"To Kill a Mockingbird": "Harper Lee",
	"The Great Gatsby": "F. Scott Fitzgerald"
}

books_default = defaultdict(lambda: "Book not found",books)  
# Access the key "Brave New World"
author = books_default["Brave New World"]  
print(author) 

```

For the default factory function, we use a simple lambda function that returns the string "Book not found". This function is called whenever you try to access a key that's not present in the dictionary.

Running the above snippet should also give you:

```
Output >>> Book not found
```

Using `defaultdict` can be especially helpful when you need to dynamically access many keys.

## Conclusion

And that's a wrap! I hope you learned how to handle KeyError exceptions in Python. Let's review what we learned:

* To explicitly handle a `KeyError`, you can wrap the dictionary access code with a `try` block, and catch the `KeyError` in the `except` block.
* Use the `get()` method to access the value of a key, with the option to return a default value if the key does not exist.
* You can initialize a `defaultdict` from the `collections` module with a factory function that returns the default value.
