If you've been hunting for a comprehensive course that dives deep into the world of API testing and automation, your search ends here. We just posted a new course on the freeCodeCamp.org YouTube channel that will teach you how to use Postman to write and automate API tests.

The course is designed and curated by none other than Valentin Despa. He is an expereinced developer and has created many popular courses around Postman.

### Course Overview

**Unit 1 - Introduction to API testing**: The course begins by establishing a strong foundation in API testing. Here, you will be introduced to the concept of APIs, their testing, and how to manually test APIs using Postman. You will learn to handle secrets with Postman variables, write scripts, and debug them using the Postman console. The unit further explores JavaScript basics, and how to access and pass data between requests.

**Unit 2 - Writing API Tests**: In this unit, you'll explore the structure of API tests, make assertions about the status code, and get hands-on with the JSON format. From asserting the data-type of a property to validating JSON schemas and testing response headers, this unit is an in-depth exploration of API testing.

**Unit 3 - Automation First Steps**: This unit takes you through the initial steps of automation. You'll learn about the collection runner, scheduled runs, and the Postman CLI. It's an exciting part of the course that demonstrates how to run a collection using Postman CLI.

**Unit 4 - Integrating Postman Tests in CI/CD**: The final unit dives into the heart of continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD). From learning about CI/CD providers to running Postman tests with GitHub Actions and other CI/CD tools, this unit is the last stepping stone in your journey to become a proficient API tester.

As you progress through the course, you'll be presented with assignments to consolidate your understanding and gain hands-on experience. On successful completion, you'll have the opportunity to claim your badge as a testament to your new skills.

This course is a great opportunity for those looking to specialize in API testing, harnessing the power of Postman for test automation. Whether you're an absolute beginner or a seasoned professional, this course is designed to offer value at all levels.
