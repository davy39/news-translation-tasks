Netlify CEO Matt Biilmann live-codes a Sudoku app using Netlify in this tutorial video. Matt shows how simple and quick it can be to create a working app using the JAMstack.

Matt starts with the create-react-app-lambda boilerplate and then builds Sudoku using React and Netlify. He explains and teaches along the way. We recorded this during the 2018 freeCodeCamp JAMstack Hackathon.

Matt co-founded Netlify in 2014. He's raised more than $44 million in venture capital funding. But he hasn't lost his coding chops.

You can watch the [full video on the freeCodeCamp.org YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GytUZLK4kwA) (1.5 hour watch).

Netlify is a San Francisco-based Platform-as-a-Service that builds, deploys, and hosts static websites and apps. You can learn more and create a free account to host your websites here: [https://www.netlify.com](https://www.netlify.com)
