Java has been a popular programming language for over two decades. Learning Java is a good way to mastering the fundamentals of modern coding practices. 

We just posted a full course on the freeCodeCamp.org YouTube channel that will teach you the basics of Java programming. Alex Dobinca Cristian developed this course. He is known for his great Udemy courses, and now brings this course to our channel.

Java, as a programming language, is celebrated for its 'Write Once, Run Anywhere' principle. This means that code written in Java can run on any device that has a Java Virtual Machine (JVM), making it incredibly versatile. Here are some compelling reasons why learning Java should be on your checklist:

1. **Popularity & Demand**: According to various industry surveys, Java consistently ranks among the top programming languages in terms of usage, demand, and popularity.
2. **Foundation for Mobile Apps**: Java is one of the primary language for Android app development, which commands a significant share of the mobile app market.
3. **Enterprise Applications**: From banking software to big e-commerce websites, Java plays a pivotal role in enterprise-level application development.
4. **Community Support**: Given its longevity, Java has a massive community of developers, meaning a plethora of resources, forums, and libraries are at your disposal.
5. **Career Opportunities**: Java developers are always in demand, and mastering it can open doors to various roles in the tech industry.

Here's a brief overview of the course sections:

**Setting the Stage**:

* _Install Intellij IDEA_: Begin your Java journey by setting up the most popular Java IDE.
* _Hello World_: Dive into coding with the quintessential first program.

**Understanding the Building Blocks**:

* _Keywords Explained_: Grasp the significance of reserved words in Java.
* _Variables_: Learn about data storage and manipulation.
* _Data Types_: Delve deep into various data types like int, byte, long, short, float, double, boolean, and char.

* _Operators and Operations_: Master the arithmetic and logical tools at your disposal.
* _Control Structures_: Understand if statements, nested ifs, and the SWITCH statement, including its enhanced version.
* _Looping Mechanisms_: Get acquainted with the FOR loop and the while & do-while loops.

**Unfolding Functions and Arrays**:

* _Functions_: Learn to write modular code with functions and understand the concept of returning values.
* _Arrays_: Delve into this crucial data structure, including a special challenge to test your skills.

**Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**:

* _Classes & OOP Basics_: Understand the pillars of OOP with classes, getters, setters, and constructors.
* _Advanced OOP_: Explore inheritance and the significance of the 'static' keyword.
