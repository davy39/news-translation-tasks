Smart home automation brings convenience and innovation to everyday living, and now you can create your own smart system from scratch. By using ESP32 microcontrollers, LEDs, servo motors, and either a Raspberry Pi or your laptop, you’ll gain the skills to build a complete home automation system with this project-based course. This course emphasizes industry-standard tools and best practices, making it an excellent resource for beginners and experienced developers alike.

We just published a **Home Automation with ESP32** course on the freeCodeCamp.org YouTube channel, created by Ebenezer Asabre. This course walks you through every step of building a smart system, from setting up the hardware to developing a web-based control interface. By the end of the course, you’ll have a fully functional system that you can customize and expand further.

### What You’ll Learn

* **Hardware Setup**: You’ll start by setting up the ESP32 microcontroller, LEDs, and servo motors, establishing a solid hardware foundation for your smart system.
    
* **System Architecture**: Understand how different components—hardware, software, and communication protocols—work together to create a seamless system. You’ll also learn to design a software flowchart to guide your project development.
    
* **MQTT Protocol**: Learn how to configure the ESP32 as an MQTT client to send and receive messages. The MQTT protocol is a key technology for Internet of Things (IoT) projects, enabling efficient communication.
    
* **Database Management**: Use PostgreSQL to manage your system’s data and integrate it with a Node.js server. You’ll set up models for storing and handling automation system information.
    
* **Server Design**: Master the modular structure of a Node.js server with service, controller, and route modules, making your application maintainable and scalable.
    
* **Real-Time Communication**: Implement an MQTT broker and real-time communication using Socket.io to establish reliable connections between your ESP32 devices and control interface.
    
* **Web-Based Control**: Build a user-friendly front end using HTML and Embedded JavaScript (EJS). This interface will let you control your smart devices remotely and interact with your system intuitively.
    

### Why Take This Course?

This course is perfect for anyone interested in IoT, whether you're a hobbyist exploring automation or a developer looking to expand your skill set. You'll gain practical experience with popular technologies like ESP32, MQTT, PostgreSQL, and Node.js, all while working on a real-world project. By the end of the course, you'll understand how to design, build, and deploy smart systems using industry-standard tools and techniques.

### What You’ll Achieve

* **Practical Knowledge**: Work hands-on with ESP32 microcontrollers and key IoT technologies.
    
* **Software Development Skills**: Create robust applications using Node.js, MQTT, and PostgreSQL.
    
* **System Design Expertise**: Learn to design and build scalable, real-time systems.
    
* **A Portfolio Project**: Develop a fully functional home automation system you can showcase to employers or use as a foundation for future projects.
