ChatGPT can be used to supercharge software development. You even create complete applications with ChatGPT.

We just published a course on the freeCodeCamp.org YouTube channel that will show you how you can create a full stack app with ChatGPT. This course, authored by Judy from webdecoded, leverages the power of ChatGPT to simplify and accelerate the development process.

Judy is an experienced full-stack developer and an enthusiastic teacher who is passionate about creating educational content to empower developers around the world.

In this course, Judy guides you through the process of building an educational application that harnesses the power of ChatGPT. You'll learn how to use ChatGPT to ask questions about coding syntax, troubleshooting, and learning best practices. Also, the course will walk you through various practical applications of ChatGPT, such as building features like authentication, browsing courses, and categories.

By the end of the course, you will not only have a fully functional application under your belt but also a solid understanding of how to incorporate ChatGPT into your future development projects.
