On this week's episode of the podcast, I interview YK Sugi. He's a software engineer and prolific YouTube Computer Science tutorial creator.

He's worked at Google and Microsoft. He runs the CS Dojo channel where he shares his insights on software development, AI, and developer career progressions.

We talk about:

* Emerging AI tools and how developers are adopting them
    
* The role of interest rates in developer hiring
    
* Japan's developer work culture VS the US
    
* How not to burn out
    

Can you guess what song I'm playing in the intro?
