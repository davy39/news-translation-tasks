Update July 15, 2020: Thank you for your interest in this project. Since our nonprofit is focused on helping adult learners, we have decided to step aside and let organizations who are focused on K-12 take the lead.

Here are a few resources I think will be helpful to K-12 teachers and parents as they prepare for the new school year:

* [Open Culture's list of K-12 Resources](http://www.openculture.com/free_k-12_educational_resources)
* [Arizona State University's list of K-12 teaching resources](https://education.asu.edu/teaching-resources-k-12-educators)
* [AmStat's list of K-12 Teacher Resources](https://www.amstat.org/ASA/Education/K-12-Educators.aspx)
