It may not be possible to code a [Minecraft clone in 30 seconds](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MAlSjtxy5ak), but you can definitely create one in under two hours.

We just published a course on the freeCodeCamp.org YouTube channel that will teach you how to create a fully-functional Minecraft clone using React, JavaScript, and Three.js.

Daniel Bark created this course. Daniel is a senior software engineer from Sweden and is an expert with Three.js.

Three.js is a JavaScript 3D library that allows developers to create and display animated 3D computer graphics in web browsers.

In this course, you will create a game that supports five Minecraft block types. It will include moving, jumping, switching and placing blocks, saving, and more.

You will learn about many React concepts such as useState, useEffect, useRef and custom Hooks for State management. And you will be able to apply the principles to create other 3D games in JavaScript.
