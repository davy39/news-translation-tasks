Here’s a diagram of the biggest codebases in history, as measured by lines of code:

As you can see, Google has by far the largest codebase of all. And all 2 billion lines of code fits into a single code repository.

But it isn’t a Git repository. Google [uses its own version control system](https://fcc.im/2rRzwDZ), which was designed specifically for its 62,000 employees (about 1/3 of whom are developers) to collaborate efficiently.

The distinction of “largest Git repository” goes to Microsoft, who announced today that their Windows Git repository has:

* approximately 3.5M files that
* results in a Git repo of about 300 gigabytes in size
* with 4,000 engineers producing 1,760 daily “lab builds” across 440 branches, plus thousands of pull request validation builds.

You can read all about how the Windows team manages this complexity with Git here: ([11 minute read](https://fcc.im/2qdxiBT))
