At the end of 2019 I promised that 2020 would be all about my [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCeU-1X402kT-JlLdAitxSMA). So that's what I've been doing. ?

On the first day of January I started the [**#31Days31Videos** challenge](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLgBH1CvjOA62ktHHwqSYBeq4jmGmUezNo) in which I had to upload a video on my channel, every single day, for the entire month of January.

You can find all the videos in [this playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLgBH1CvjOA62ktHHwqSYBeq4jmGmUezNo). They cover topics like: **HTML**, **CSS**, **JavaScript**, **React** and some tips for website development.

Among the 31 videos, I also did [11 Live Streams](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLgBH1CvjOA60_luVqIrAnldx1v0KIbxGy) in which we (the community and I) built a couple of projects and websites. ([Landing Page](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=069NlLdB4dM), [Portfolio Website](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9gn8SbGPfk), [Countries REST Web App](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIj8wbvxZIk), [ReactJS App](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRjlY-NobZY) and much more...)

So that makes up to a total of **42 videos** uploaded to my YouTube channel in January 2020. A lot of work, I must say. ? But it was a lot of fun too!

Now let's see how this helped my channel...

## Before the Challenge

I started uploading videos to the channel on 7th November 2019. By the end of the year I had uploaded 11 videos and I did 2 Live Streams which got me:

- **1,800 Subscribers**
- **13,400 Views**
- **430 Watch Time (hours)**

## After the Challenge

As mentioned above, in January 2020 I uploaded 31 videos (for the **#31Days31Videos** challenge) and I did 11 Live Streams which got me an additional:

- **4,000 Subscribers**
- **~54,000 Views**
- **2,600 Watch Time (hours)**

Here is a screenshot of January analytics:

Besides uploading the videos I also worked a lot on sharing them on multiple Social Media platforms like: Twitter, LinkedIn, Instagram, Facebook, Reddit, HackerNews, IndieHackers, Dev.to, and FreeCodeCamp.

People say I'm everywhere and... that's true ?. Nowadays it's important to have as many eyes ? on your content as possible because you never know what could happen. And thanks to Social Media it's easier than ever to do that.

And I also had a couple of collaborations with **Brad Traversy**, **Creative-Tim** and **FrontendMentors** which helped with "spreading the word" about my channel.

## Future Plans

Now that the challenge is over I'm planning to continue to upload at least 3 videos and do 1 Live Stream every week.

Also, I'm looking for more collaborations with other YouTubers and/or companies which would be interested in this so that I can get in front of more people.

The **mighty goal of 2020** is to get to **100,000 Subscribers**! ?

Until then though, I want to reach **4,000** watch time hours (800 hours left) in order to be able to monetize the channel. This will help a lil' considering that this is all that I do now... (It will help a lil' more actually ?).

And... There will be more challenges, because that's how we roll! ?

Have you heard about my plans to conquer the **freeCodeCamp curriculum** in a series of Live Streams? ? Stay tuned for more info about it!

## Conclusion

Although it was a lot of work producing the content, it was a fun month. I've learned a lot along the way, made new friends for which I'm very grateful and I'm very happy that I did something that I really enjoyed doing. I hope that it will continue this way! ?

In the meantime... Happy coding! ?
