[**Discover Functional JavaScript**](https://read.amazon.com/kp/embed?asin=B07PBQJYYG&preview=newtab&linkCode=kpe&ref_=cm_sw_r_kb_dp_cm5KCbE5BDJGE) was named one of the [**best new Functional Programming books by BookAuthority**](https://bookauthority.org/books/new-functional-programming-books?t=7p46zt&s=award&book=1095338781)**!**

A common way to split responsibilities in an application is to separate them into the three principal layers:

* UI (aka Presentation)
* domain (aka Business)
* data access

Some of the benefits of doing so are:

* a better understanding of the layer’s purpose
* the layer implementation can be replaced. For example we can switch between AngularJS, VueJS, and ReactJS in the UI layer.
* multiple UI Layers can be implemented over the same domain layer
* the UI can be hard to test. By moving the logic to other layers, it becomes easier to test.
