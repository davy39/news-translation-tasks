Firebase is an app development platform from Google that offers tools and services for building and scaling applications. It includes real-time databases, authentication, analytics, and hosting features.

We just published a course on the freeCodeCamp.org YouTube channel that will teach you how to build a mobile app with HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Google Firebase. By the end of the course, you'll have a working app that you can deploy to Netlify and share with the world.

Created by Rafid Hoda, a skilled teacher at Scrimba, this comprehensive course will guide you through the process of creating a mobile app from scratch.

You'll begin by setting up the app skeleton and adding CSS to style the app. Next, you'll explore Firebase Realtime Database and add Firebase to your project. You'll also learn how to set up security rules to protect your data.

With Firebase in place, you'll learn how to use innerHTML to append list items to a list, and then refactor your code to make it more efficient. You'll also learn how to turn an object into an array, fetch database items in real-time using onValue, and update items in real-time.

As you continue through the course, you'll learn how to render database items using a for loop, fix bugs in the app, and use flexbox flex-wrap and gap to style the app. You'll also learn how to add hover styles to buttons, prevent text selection using user-select, and set the viewport for the app.

To make the app more mobile-friendly, you'll add a favicon and phone icons, and use a web application manifest to turn the web app into a "mobile" app. You'll also learn how to personalize the app, deploy it to Netlify, add it to the home screen, and share it with others.

Overall, this course is a great way to learn how to build a mobile app from scratch using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Google Firebase. With its step-by-step approach and hands-on exercises, this course is suitable for both beginners and more experienced developers looking to expand their skills.
