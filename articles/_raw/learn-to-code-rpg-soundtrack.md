## How I Made The Learn to Code RPG Soundtrack

The Funk of the 70s.  
The Jazz of the 80s.  
The Hip Hop of the 90s.

I was a lover of music. But I never really learned how to play.

That changed 3 months into the pandemic. I bought an electric bass. I clocked several hundred hours in Rocksmith practicing the bass lines of Nathan East, Bootsy Collins, and Andy Rourke from The Smiths.

For theory, I made heavy use of Musician YouTube, including [Rick Beato](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qFVpSjRUD2E&list=PLW0NGgv1qnfzb1klL6Vw9B0aiM7ryfXV_) and [Adam Neely](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBIXDov8G80&list=PLBcZM94cb2Ux02BDGRwFcD09EsFe8T7rr), and most importantly [Paul Del Bello](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OgipSAdZiKw&list=PL_KwW-re--9GGknaye6BBmWeRNqL95xiJ).

I also got guidance from two musicians in the freeCodeCamp community: Lawrence Yeo (AKA [Trebles and Blues](https://open.spotify.com/artist/5K2ELFl9mZj4wSulXtgUcV)) and Devin Lane (AKA [Gentle Return](https://open.spotify.com/artist/7dFoXdChS3pVrba3MyuuTu)). Check out their tunes.

Before long I came to realize that almost any piece of music could potentially sound good with nothing more than drums, bass, and a piano. But I didn't want to find a drummer or a pianist, so I set out to learn how to play those instruments myself.

_My gear – a Fender Precision bass, Roland Octopad, and M-Audio midi controller_

I started by learning to read music, doing ear training, memorizing the circle of fifths – all the things I presume you learn in music school. But I quickly abandoned that in favor of just sitting down and writing songs.

I bought a $100 midi controller and a $200 copy of Logic Pro, then got to work learning how to compose chords and melodies, and play to a metronome.

It took about 6 months, but I recorded dozens of instrumental tracks, 10 of which made it into the first release of Learn to Code RPG. I am working on several more songs with similar tempos and instrumentation for future expansions to the game.

## How do you make your keyboard sounds?

I build my synth patches using Logic's built-in Alchemy additive synth and its analog synth. I also use some of Logic's stock pianos, electric pianos, organs, and its celesta.

## What do you use for drums?

I play a heavily modified Logic producer drum kit on a Roland Octopad. I use heavy muting and very few plugins. I'm going for a dry, crisp 1970s sound.

You may notice that I only use the kick, snare, ride, and hi-hat. That is all that the 70s greats like Clyde Stubblefield and Gregory Coleman needed to build grooves. So I imposed that constraint upon myself. (I find that reasonable constraints can accelerate the creative process.)

Rather than playing the classic 70s breakbeats, I attempt to weave my own around the song's bass line.

## What is that kick drum sound?

A booming house music kick layered on top of a clicky death metal kick.

## What is that bass sound?

The bass you hear on the Learn to Code RPG soundtrack is a fattened-up analog synth sound with some delay and distortion. I can't quite play bass tight enough for studio-grade recordings, and rather than chopping it my playing, I just played on a keyboard. I EQ the bass at 40 Hz to make room room for the kick, and so it still sounds OK on a phone's speakers.

## Can I use your music in my videos / on my live stream?

DM me on Twitter and we can discuss this.

## Can you play my tech conference / roller skating rink / art opening?

That sounds like a blast. DM me on Twitter.

Thanks for reading about my music. I never thought I'd discover a new all-consuming passion at age 40. But it has been a blast. And I am just getting started. If I am lucky, I will still have 40 years left in me to learn music and create work I am proud of.
