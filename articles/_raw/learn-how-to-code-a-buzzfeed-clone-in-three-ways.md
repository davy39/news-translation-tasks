Are you looking to level up your web development skills? Do you want to know how to build a BuzzFeed clone in three different technologies? Look no further! 

We just published a 4-hour video course on the freeCodeCamp.org YouTube channel that will teach you how to code a BuzzFeed clone using three different methods.

Ania Kubów developed this course. She is a very popular software course creator and frequent contributor to the freeCodeCamp.org YouTube channel.

In this comprehensive course, you will learn how to build a BuzzFeed clone in JavaScript, followed by a version in React using JSON server for mimicking an API, and finally build a TypeScript Buzzfeed Clone with a mini backend using Node.js to communicate with a database. By the end of the course, you will have a solid understanding of how to build a BuzzFeed clone in three different technologies, ranging in difficulty from beginner to intermediate.

As part of the project, you will build a quiz for people to take that asks "What cheese are you?" Using cool scroll logic that you will develop in the course, the quiz will automatically scroll to the next question after a user answers a question. You'll learn how to use JavaScript to create an interactive quiz that will keep users engaged and entertained.

The course is designed for beginners who have a basic understanding of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, but anyone with an interest in web development can benefit from it. The instructor is experienced and knowledgeable, and the course is designed to be easy to follow, so you can start building your BuzzFeed clone right away.

This course perfect for those looking to level up their web development skills or for those who just want to learn how to build an interactive quiz.
