Here are three links worth your time:

1. Google cofounder Sergey Brin talks about AI, automation, and the future of education ([34 minute watch](http://bit.ly/2lTKmdi))
2. A brief history of random numbers ([8 minute read](http://bit.ly/2mjxZCw))
3. Priest Willis interviews me about freeCodeCamp and the future of education ([40 minute listen](http://bit.ly/2mjoSTz))

### Thought of the day:

> “Everyone should have access to education. Primary education, secondary, university, and for that matter, post-graduate work. Those things are extraordinarily expensive today, but that’s an artifact of the infrastructure. We assume we need big buildings and fancy classrooms and things like that. I don’t think those are necessary. It’s fine to have those for some folks. But education should be universally accessible.” — Sergey Brin

### Funny of the day:
