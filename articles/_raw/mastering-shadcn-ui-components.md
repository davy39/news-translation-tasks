We just published a course on the [freeCodeCamp.org](http://freeCodeCamp.org) YouTube channel that will help you master Shadcn. This comprehensive course dives deep into the versatile world of Shadcn, a powerful toolset for building modern web applications with customizable and reusable components. Mathew from CodeByDesign designed this course.

### What is Shadcn?

Shadcn is not your typical component library. Instead of installing it as a dependency through npm, Shadcn offers a collection of beautifully designed, accessible, and customizable React components that you can copy and paste directly into your project. This unique approach allows developers to have complete control over their components, enabling greater customization and integration flexibility.

The Shadcn components are designed to be easily integrated into any React or Next.js project. They come with built-in styling options and support theming through CSS variables or Tailwind CSS utility classes, making it simple to maintain a consistent look and feel across your application.

This course covers all the main UI components provided by Shadcn, offering a thorough introduction and practical examples to help you get started quickly.

### Why Learn Shadcn?

Shadcn offers a flexible and efficient way to build modern web applications with React and Next.js. By mastering Shadcn, you can:

* Speed up your development process by reusing high-quality, pre-built components.
    
* Maintain complete control over your component styling and behavior.
    
* Ensure your application is accessible and user-friendly with components designed with accessibility in mind.
    

Whether you are a beginner looking to get started with React UI components or an experienced developer aiming to enhance your toolkit, this course provides valuable insights and practical knowledge to help you succeed.
