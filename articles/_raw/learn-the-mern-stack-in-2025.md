If you’ve been meaning to learn full-stack web development but don’t know where to start, this new course is a solid way in. Whether you're aiming to get a job in web dev or just want to build your own projects, understanding how the pieces fit together is a huge step. And the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) is one of the most in-demand setups out there.

We just published a complete MERN stack course on the [freeCodeCamp.org](http://freeCodeCamp.org) YouTube channel. It’s beginner-friendly, and it walks you through everything from setting up your development environment to deploying a real-world notes app with full CRUD functionality. Burak, your instructor, explains every step clearly and doesn’t skip over the parts that usually trip people up.

You’ll build something useful while picking up important backend concepts like route handling, controllers, middleware, and rate limiting. On the frontend, you’ll create a clean, responsive UI using React. It’s practical and hands-on, so by the end, you’ll not only understand how to build and connect a REST API with a frontend, but you’ll have deployed your app too.

### What’s covered:

* **Project Preview:** A quick look at what you'll be building: a simple but polished notes app.
    
* **Backend Setup:** Start by initializing your Node.js project and learning the basics of Express.
    
* **Nodemon & Routes:** Set up development tools like Nodemon and build your first API routes.
    
* **Organizing Your Code:** Structure your folders and files in a clean, scalable way.
    
* **MongoDB:** Connect to a MongoDB database and start storing your notes.
    
* **Controllers:** Create controller functions to handle your API logic cleanly.
    
* **Middleware & Rate Limiting:** Add middleware functions for error handling and security features like rate limiting.
    
* **Frontend Setup:** Start building the React frontend and connect it to your backend.
    
* **Home Page:** Display all notes pulled from the backend.
    
* **Create Page:** Add the UI and logic for creating new notes.
    
* **Delete Functionality:** Let users delete notes and sync the frontend with the backend.
    
* **Detail Page:** Show individual note details on a separate page.
    
* **Deployment:** Learn how to deploy the whole app, step by step, with extra attention to details that most tutorials skip.
