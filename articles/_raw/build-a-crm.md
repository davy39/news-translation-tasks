A Customer Relationship Management (CRM) is a system that helps businesses organize and manage their customer relationships. It is basically a big database for customer information.

Since every business is a little different, it can be helpful to create your own CRM to meet your exact needs.

We just published a course on the freeCodeCamp.org YouTube channel that will teach you how to build your own CRM, using almost no code.

Ania Kubów developed this course. Ania is an experienced developer and course creator who has taught software skills to millions of people.

In this course you will learn how to build a CRM using the Retool low-code platform. You will learn how to use the Google Sheet API, Stripe API, SMTP API, as well as a PostgreSQL database.

After learning the basics of the low-code platform, you will learn about:

* Getting Data using the Google Sheets API
* Creating Tables
* Adding Data using the Google Sheets API
* Deleting Data using the Google Sheets API
* Processing refunds with the Stripe API
* Sending emails with SMTP
