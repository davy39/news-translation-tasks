On this week's episode of the podcast, I interview Shashi Lo. He's a software engineer at Microsoft. He grew up the child of refugees. He wanted to start earning money and build his family so he abandoned his art school degree and taught himself how to program.

He immediately hustled to land freelance development clients – something he still does today on top of his full time job and raising his 4 kids.

We talk about:

* Making ends meet doing freelance work
    
* How to bootstrap your reputation toward getting a job in big tech
    
* Mistakes he sees careers changers make
    
* The pros and cons of working in big tech VS working at developer agencies
