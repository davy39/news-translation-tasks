C# and ASP.NET are used as the server-side programming language on many websites.

We've released a course on the freeCodeCamp.org YouTube channel that will teach you how to create a web database app in ASP.NET Core using Visual Studio and the C# language.

The course was created by Shad Sluiter. Shad is a professor of computer science at Grand Canyon University. Over the past 20 years he has taught students from grade 6 to senior citizens in many aspects of technology.

The web app you will create is a basic CRUD app that interacts with a database. 

This tutorial will show you how to:

* Use the MVC (Model View Controller) design pattern.
* Configure database tables using the Entity framework.
* Setup classes as models. 
* Customize Razor forms.
* Create methods inside a controller.
* Style an ASP.NET page with CSS.
* Use Bootstrap classes.
* Create a search function to filter database results.

Watch the full course on [the freeCodeCamp.org YouTube channel](https://youtu.be/BfEjDD8mWYg) (1-hour watch).
