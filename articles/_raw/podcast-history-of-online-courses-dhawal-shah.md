On this week's podcast, I'm joined by Dhawal Shah, the creator of Class Central, a popular search engine for online courses.

Dhawal shares the history of online courses and the Massive Open Online Course revolution of the early 2010s. 

We also talk about his childhood growing up in India, and how his life changed one day when he won a computer from a Cartoon Network sweepstakes.
