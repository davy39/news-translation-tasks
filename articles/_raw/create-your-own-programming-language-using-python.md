# Create Your Own Programming Language with Advanced Python: A Deep Dive into the Art of Language Design

Imagine being able to build your own programming language from scratch. The ability to design and create a language tailored to your own vision and specifications is an incredible achievement for any programmer.

We just published a course on the freeCodeCamp.org YouTube channel that will show you how to create your own programming language while teaching you advanced Python.

This course is designed for people who already have a fundamental understanding of Python and are eager to explore the depths of computer science and language design. This hands-on curriculum teaches you the underpinnings of how programming languages work, and how you can build one using Python.

Starting with the basics, the course helps you understand the logical foundation of computers with topics like logic gates, arithmetic operations, and computer memory. This is essential as it sets the stage for you to understand the structure and behavior of programming languages at their core.

As you dive deeper, you’ll begin understanding the process of building a programming language through lexical analysis and parsing, crucial steps in interpreting source code. This course also provides an in-depth understanding of object-oriented programming (OOP). With an emphasis on encapsulation, abstraction, inheritance, and polymorphism, you will learn how these fundamental principles play a significant role in language design and development.

The course also covers essential data structures like lists, tuples, dictionaries, stacks, and binary trees, and how these can be efficiently implemented in Python. You will also learn about various tree traversal techniques, which are essential in certain language features.

Once you’ve established a strong foundation, the course delves into the practical aspect - building your own interpreter. This section is where things get exciting as you practically use Python to create a lexer, parser, and interpreter. This trio is the heart of any programming language. The course meticulously guides you through handling expressions, variables, unary operations, Boolean, comparison operators, and control statements like if statements and loops.

By the end of this course, you’ll not only have a firm understanding of the intricate mechanics behind programming languages but also have built your own language with Python. 

Whether you’re an aspiring language designer, a computer science student, or a coding enthusiast, this course is a goldmine waiting to be explored.
