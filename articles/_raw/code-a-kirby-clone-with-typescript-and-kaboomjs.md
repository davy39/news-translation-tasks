If you are learning programming, it should be fun!

We just posted a video course on the freeCodeCamp.org YouTube channel that will guide you through the process of creating a Kirby game clone using TypeScript and Kaboom.js. JSLegendDev created this course.

TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript that adds optional static typing and other features to improve the development experience. It's designed to help developers catch errors early and improve code maintainability, making it a popular choice for large and complex applications.

Kaboom.js is a JavaScript library for creating games and interactive experiences. It provides a simple and intuitive API for handling tasks such as rendering, input handling, and physics, making it perfect for beginners and experienced developers alike. Kaboom.js is built on top of the popular Pixi.js library and adds a lot of useful features and tools to make game development a breeze.
