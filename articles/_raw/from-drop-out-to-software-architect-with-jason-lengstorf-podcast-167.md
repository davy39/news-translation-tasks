On this week's episode of the podcast, I interview Jason Lengstorf. He learned to code out of necessity building websites for local emo bands.

He dropped out of college but eventually worked as an engineer at IBM and has gone on to roles at many other companies, doing everything from software architecture to management. He runs CodeTV, a Bravo-style reality TV channel for developers.

We talk about:

* Jason's winding path into development from building websites for bands
    
* Teaching yourself programming by chasing your curiosity
    
* How in-person events gives you tacit knowledge that makes you a better engineer
    
* How a having broad range of skills ultimately helps you build better projects
