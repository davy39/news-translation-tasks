Object Oriented Programming is a common method of structuring programs that all developers should make time to properly understand.

It involves bundling related properties and behaviors into individual objects.

We released a crash course on the freeCodeCamp.org YouTube channel that will teach you the basics of object oriented programming. The course was developed by Steven and Sean from NullPointer Exception.

In this course, you will learn what object oriented programming means and you will learn about its four main principles.

Here are the four principles that are covered:

* Encapsulation
* Abstraction
* Inheritance
* Polymorphism

You should have some knowledge of programming before starting. If you need a refresher on basic programming concepts, watch [this introduction to computer programming course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zOjov-2OZ0E).

This course does not focus on a single programming language. The concepts you learn will apply to any language that supports object oriented programming such as Java, C++, Python, and JavaScript.

Watch the [course on the freeCodeCamp.org YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SiBw7os-_zI) (30 minute watch).
