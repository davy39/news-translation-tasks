Chatbots should do more than just chat.

We just published a new course on the [freeCodeCamp.org](http://freeCodeCamp.org) YouTube channel that will teach you how to build a smart AI shopping assistant from the ground up.

This comprehensive course, created by Ania Kubow, goes beyond typical chatbot tutorials. You will create a powerful AI agent that thinks and acts like a real sales associate, capable of making its own decisions to help customers.

This AI agent can:

* Autonomously decide when to search a database versus when to respond directly.
    
* Use custom tools to search through real product information.
    
* Remember past parts of the conversation.
    
* Take multi-step actions to perceive, plan, act, and respond to a customer.
    

Throughout the course, you will work with modern, cutting-edge technologies. You'll use LangGraph for agent orchestration, MongoDB Atlas for vector search and memory, and Google's Gemini to power the AI's brain. Ania explains everything step-by-step, so you don't need to be an expert in these tools to get started.

By the time you finish, you will have built a complete project with three parts: a Node.js backend, a MongoDB database with AI-generated product data, and a user-friendly React frontend.

Watch the full course on [the freeCodeCamp.org YouTube channel](https://youtu.be/9tANiA0LKn4) (2-hour watch).
