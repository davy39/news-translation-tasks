Chatbots are being used everywhere. And an AI chatbot is a great project to help learn the MERN Stack.

We just posted a new video course on the freeCodeCamp.org YouTube channel that will teach you how to create an AI chatbot with the MERN Stack. This course was created by Nikhil Thadani.

Nikhil will guide you step-by-step on how to build a ChatGPT Clone - a secure and scalable AI chatbot using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node) complemented with advanced authentication. With the use of React, Node, MongoDB, Express, and Typescript, you'll not only develop a chatbot but will gain a profound understanding of creating advanced, production-ready SaaS applications with the MERN stack.

Here's a snapshot of the key features you can expect from this course:

* Comprehensive guide on the MERN stack.
* Creation of a robust user authentication and authorization system.
* Implementation of express-validators middleware for data validation.
* Techniques to store user chats in MongoDB securely.
* Crafting your own authentication system.
* Usage of JWT authorization tokens and HTTP only cookies.
* Ensuring user route protection with verification checks.
* Building a modern React app with Vite.
* Designing an elegant chat UI with the Material UI library.
* Assurance of a complete responsive design with a modern flair.
* Integration of OpenAI with Node and Express MERN stack app.
* Creation of a full-stack ChatGPT-like clone.
* Effective storage of user sessions.

The course is structured in a way to ensure gradual learning, starting with the basics and moving to advanced topics. From setting up Node and Express to designing the chat page UI, and from integrating OpenAI with a NodeJS application to creating a chat completion route request, this course has it all. You'll also learn about setting up frontend applications, designing UI elements, and ensuring user authentication.

Here are all the topics you will learn in this course:

* The significance of the MERN Stack and reasons to choose it.
* Building a real-world app with MERN STACK.
* Initiating your journey with MERN Stack.
* Creation of a basic Node and Express app.
* Building a full-stack project, focusing on an AI chatbot.
* Leveraging OpenAI to enhance your chatbot.
* Implementation of advanced authentication techniques.
* Designing a responsive React project using Vite.
* Mastering design with the Material UI Component Library.
* Secure API calls with frontend and backend integration using Axios.
* And many more full stack project ideas!
