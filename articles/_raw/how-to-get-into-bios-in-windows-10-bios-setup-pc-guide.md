BIOS stands for Basic Input/Output System. It is embedded into computers as a motherboard chip and is primarily responsible for booting the computer system.

Apart from booting up your computer, BIOS is responsible for a lot of other functionality behind the scenes – like managing data flow between an operating system and attached hardware devices such as printers, mouse, keyboard hard disk, and scanners. 

Once everything has been certified OK during startup, your computer will boot successfully. Otherwise, an error message such as the BSOD (blue screen of death) or several others will be displayed. 

If you can access BIOS on your PC, you can do various things such as change hard drive settings, create a password for BIOS to make your computer more secure, change the boot order, and more. 

So, in this article, I’m going to show you two ways you can get into BIOS in Windows 10.

## How to Get into BIOS in Windows 10 Through Settings

**Step 1**: Click on Start and select Settings to open up the Settings app. Or simply press `WIN` (Windows key) + `I`.

**Step 5**: After your PC reboots, you'll see a blue background menu containing options like “Continue”, “Troubleshoot”, and “Turn off your PC”. Click on Troubleshoot.

**Step 6**: Click on “Advanced options”

**Step 7**: Select “UEFI Firmware Settings” to finally enter your computer BIOS. 

And that's it - you should be in.

If you don’t find UEFI Firmware Settings, using hotkeys to enter BIOS will come to the rescue. Let's look at how to use them now.

## How to Get into BIOS in Windows 10 Through Hotkeys

Some computer manufacturers give users several keys or key combinations to press while booting so they can enter BIOS. This is typically the F2 key on many devices, but there are a few exceptions.

The table below shows the hotkeys for entering BIOS in different brands of computers.

HP: ESC (Escape) to enter startup menu, then F10 or F12.

| Brand | Hotkey(s)|
| ----------- | ----------- |
| ACER      | `F2` or `DEL` (Delete)|
| Toshiba | `F2`|
|Lenovo Thinkpad|`ENTER` + `F1`|
|Lenovo Desktop|`F1`|
|Dell|`F2`|
|MSI|`DEL` |
|Samsung|`F2`|
|Sony |`F2`|
|Origin PC|`F2`|

## Conclusion

In this guide, you learned how to get into BIOS in Windows 10, so you can have more control over your device. It also lets you dive into more settings you might not find in the Settings app. 

Windows 10 Settings provides a better way to enter BIOS on modern computers, but if you are using older devices, using hotkeys might be your best bet to get into BIOS.

If you are wondering what UEFI is, it stands for Unified Extensible Firmware Interface. It works like BIOS but provides faster boot time, and can support drive sizes up to 9 zettabytes, whereas BIOS only supports up to 2.2 terabytes.

Be careful what you do while in BIOS because whatever you tamper with might have a long-lasting effect on your Computer.

Thank you for reading.
