We've released a course on the freeCodeCamp.org YouTube channel that will teach you how to use MongoDB, Express, Node,  React, Node, and GraphQL to create a social media application.

Ahmed from the Classsed YouTube channel developed this course. He has created a bunch of popular software courses that have helped a lot of people.
