On this week's podcast, I meet with Arian Agrawal in New York City to talk about her journey into tech startups.

Arian grew up in New York and studied at MIT. She worked in finance for a few years, then built her own ecommerce Marketplace startup with a friend.

Along the way, Arian went through the South Park Commons startup accelerator, and she now leads their New York City branch as a partner.

We talk about technology, startups, and her journey from finance to building products.
