Patrick Hartley is a self-taught developer with nearly a decade of software engineering experience. When he was 21 he had to dropped out of college to provide for his family. He taught himself programming while working at a thrift store.

After building his own apps and freelancing, he became the founding engineer at startup that got acquired, and has since worked as a dev at other tech companies. A few months ago he turned down an opportunity at Amazon so he could continue to work remotely from his home in Oklahoma City.

He shares tips for:

* Teaching yourself programming while raising kids
    
* How to build foundational skills with JavaScript and Python
    
* Getting a remote job when you have to compete with the global developer talent pool
    
* Surviving as an introvert in a networking-heavy and meeting-filled profession
