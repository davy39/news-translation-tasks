On this week's episode of the podcast, I interview Gary Simon, a developer and designer who started DesignCourse and has published several courses on [freeCodeCamp.org](http://freeCodeCamp.org) over the years.

We talk about:

* Growing up in rural Ohio, marrying young, and staying out there despite his success as a developer and entrepreneur
    
* Early client work, and how he designed thousands of logos for clients before becoming an all-out web developer
    
* Using his skills to help his wife start her own lactation consultant business online
    
* Gary's guitar shredding chops
    

I recorded this podcast live and I haven't edited it at all. I want to capture the feel of a real live conversation, with all the human quirks that entails.

Can you guess what song I'm playing on my bass during the intro? It's from a 1995s Nintendo game.
