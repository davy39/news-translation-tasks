## What Can You Do on the Hugging Face Platform?

Here are some of the awesome things you can do on Hugging Face:

### Download and fine-tune existing Open Source models:

Why start from scratch when you can leverage the power of over 450k models that are already available on the Hugging Face model library? 

You can easily download these models and fine-tune them on your own custom dataset with just a few lines of code. This way, you can save time and resources, and still get a model that suits your specific needs.

You can use these models to perform various tasks, such as:

1. Natural language processing (for example, translation, summarization, and text generation)
2. Audio-related functions (for example, automatic speech recognition, voice activity detection, and text-to-speech)
3. Computer vision tasks (for example, depth estimation, image classification, and image-to-image processing),
4. Multimodal models capable of handling diverse data types (text, images, audio) and producing multiple types of output.

### Run Models directly from Hugging Face:

If you don’t want to set up these models on your own machines, you can simply use Hugging Face’s Transformer library to connect to these models, send requests, and receive outputs. 

### Add/create your own model:

If you have a brilliant idea for a new model, or you want to improve an existing one, you can also add/create your own model on Hugging Face. 

The platform will host your model, and allow you to provide additional information, upload essential files, and manage different versions. You can also choose whether your models are public or private, so you can decide when or if you want to share them with the world. 

Once your model is ready, you can access it directly from Hugging Face, send requests, and retrieve the outputs for integration into any applications you are developing.

### Use existing datasets:

A good model needs a good dataset. Hugging Face provides a repository of over 90,000 datasets that you can use and feed into your models. 

You can take an in-depth look inside the dataset using the dataset viewer. You can also contribute your own datasets to the repository, and help the machine learning community grow.

## Hugging Face Terminology

There are some terms you'll need to know to get the most out of working with Hugging Face.

**Pretrained model:** A model that has been trained on a large dataset for a specific task before being made available for use. 

**Inference:** Inference is the process of using a trained model to make predictions or draw conclusions about new, unseen data based on the learned patterns from the training data.

**Transformers:** Transformers are models that can handle text-based tasks, such as translation, summarization, and text generation. They use a special architecture that relies on attention mechanisms to capture the relationships between words and sentences.

**Tokenizer**: A tokenizer is a process that breaks down text into smaller units called tokens. Tokens are usually words or subwords that can be used for natural language processing (NLP) tasks.

### Set Up Your Environment

Before you start using the Hugging Face hub programmatically, you will need to set up your environment.  

#### Step 1: Install Python and Pip:

Make sure you have Python 3.8 or higher installed on your system. You will also need Pip, the package manager for Python, to install the Hugging Face libraries. If you don’t have Python, you can install it by following the instructions [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

#### Step 2: Install HuggingFace libraries:

Open a terminal or command prompt and run the following command to install the HuggingFace libraries: 

```shell
pip install transformers
```

This will install the core Hugging Face library along with its dependencies. To have the full capability, you should also install the datasets and the tokenizers library.

```shell
pip install tokenizers, datasets
```

#### Step 3: Set up a development environment:

Choose a code editor or IDE of your choice, such as Jupyter Notebook, PyCharm, or Visual Studio Code. Create a new project directory and set up a virtual environment to isolate your project dependencies. You can find more information on how to do this [here](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html).

With these steps completed, you have successfully set up Hugging Face on your system and are ready to start exploring its features and capabilities. Let’s go! 🚀

## How to Use Pre-Trained Models in Hugging Face

One of the best things about Hugging Face is that it gives you access to thousands of pre-trained models that can perform various tasks on different types of data. Whether you are working with text, vision, audio, or a combination of them, you can find a model that suits your needs.

Hugging Face has two main libraries that provide access to pre-trained models: **Transformers** and **Diffusers**. The Transformers library handles text-based tasks, such as translation, summarization, and text generation. Diffusers can handle image-based tasks, such as image synthesis, image editing, and image captioning.

You have already installed the transformers library during the environment setup. Let’s see how you can use it to work with pre-trained models.

### Step 1: Visit the PyPI page

To learn more about the transformers library, you can visit its page on PyPI, the Python Package Index. 

Go to [PyPi](https://pypi.org/) and search for ‘transformers’. Click on the latest version of the transformers library displayed in the search result. You will see a brief introduction of the library, as well as some useful links and information.

### Step 2: Download and use pre-trained models

The transformers library provides APIs to quickly download and use pre-trained models on a given text, fine-tune them on your own datasets, and then share them with the community on Hugging Face’s [model hub](https://huggingface.co/models).

### Step 3: Use the `pipeline()` method 

To use a pre-trained model on a given input, Hugging Face provides a `pipeline()` method, an easy-to-use API for performing a wide variety of tasks. 

The [pipeline()](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/v4.36.1/en/main_classes/pipelines#transformers.pipeline) method makes it simple to use any [model](https://huggingface.co/models) from the Hub for inference on any language, computer vision, speech, and multimodal tasks.

Let’s try to perform a task using the pipeline() method.

#### Task: Sentiment analysis:

Let’s use the `pipeline()` method to classify positive versus negative texts provided by the user:

```python
from transformers import pipeline

# Load the pre-trained sentiment analysis model
sentiment_analysis = pipeline(
"sentiment-analysis", model="distilbert-base-uncased-finetuned-sst-2-english")

input_text = [
"It’s a great app, my biggest problem is the card readers regularly do not connect. Which is very poor customer service for us because we have to manually enter our customers debit cards, which takes time. This slows down our efficiency."
]

# Perform sentiment analysis on the input text
result = sentiment_analysis(input_text)

# Print the result
print(result)
```

The pipeline statement downloads and caches the pretrained model used by the pipeline, while the statement `result = sentiment_analysis(input_text)` evaluates it on the given text. 

**Output:**

```shell
[{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9996176958084106}]
```

Here, the answer is "NEGATIVE" with a confidence of 99.96%.

#### Task: Automatic speech recognition

Let’s try another task that involves speech recognition.

```python
from transformers import pipeline

transcriber = pipeline(task="automatic-speech-recognition",
                       model="openai/whisper-small")
result = transcriber(
    "https://huggingface.co/datasets/Narsil/asr_dummy/resolve/main/mlk.flac")

print(result)
```

**Output:**

```shell
{'text': ' I have a dream that one day this nation will rise up and live out the true meaning of its creed.'}
```

You can see how easy it is to get a pre-trained model up and running using Hugging Face's libraries. 

### How to find the right pre-trained model

But how can you find the right pre-trained model if you want to perform a specific task? 

This is actually quite easy. You can browse the models on the Hugging Face website, and filter them by task, language, framework, and more. You can also search for models and datasets by keyword and sort them by trending, most likes, most downloads, or by recent updates.

![Image](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/e94ThjikQ7rAFXu-LUx6a0ZosgWFKqjfSION915OcA9fQweqZO62wLdyPkAH657OFOlO-Zw4O9WLvtQ1auZl8Oo9inxtul7J1hkuXs1Bqs10n_FRy8P6o-mhGVB_QKVEz4CHL7-mOm9wTGzbqr6gJJY)
_Searching for models_

Each model has a model card that contains important information, such as model details, inference example, training procedure, community interaction features, and link to the files. You can also try the model on the model card page by using the Inference API section.
