If you really want to understand game development, consider coding your own game engine.

We just published a 25-hour course on the freeCodeCamp.org YouTube channel that will teach you how to code your own 2D game engine using Java.

You will use the game engine to create a Super Mario Clone but the engine can be used to create other games as well.
