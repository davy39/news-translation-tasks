On this week's episode of the podcast, I interview Adam Stachoviac and Jerod Santo, co-hosts of The Changelog – the longest-running software podcast in world. They interview devs about Open Source projects, and they also have a weekly news episode that I always listen to.

5 years ago, I interviewed them for their 10th anniversary episode, and now I'm back catching up on what they've been doing for the past 5 years.

We talk about:

* How open source is changing
    
* Open data and open LLM models
    
* Self-reliance and self-hosted infrastructure
    
* The business of running a developer community
    

Can you guess what song I'm playing in the intro?
