A mobile hotspot is a quick and efficient way to share an internet connection with other devices like computers, iPads, or other mobile phones. 

A hotspot is also a good alternative to WiFi – especially if the WiFi in your area is unbearably slow or won't connect.

Sometimes, you might experience problems connecting a device to your hotspot. This is almost always due to errors in the mobile network and internet settings, and faulty or outdated drivers on your computer.

In this guide, I will show 4 ways you can fix any error associated with a hotspot connection. 

The first fix works on your Windows 10 PC, while the rest solve the problem right on your Android mobile phone.

So, updating your wireless network driver can help your computer connect to your hotspot again.

**Follow the steps below to update your wireless network driver**

## How to Fix a Hotspot Connection Error by Changing your Access Point Band to 2.4 GHz

Some Android devices have their default AP bands as 2.4GHz and it remains unchangeable, but yours could be 5GHz – which is always changeable.

**Step 1**: Open Settings.
