Are you interested in game development but don't know where to start? The Godot game engine is a popular open-source platform for game development, and our new video course on the freeCodeCamp.org YouTube channel will teach you everything you need to know to create your own platformer game.

The course starts with the basics, such as downloading and setting up the Godot project, and progresses to more advanced topics like designing enemies and incorporating UI elements. You'll learn how to create your first 2D scene, animate your player character, and make a background. You'll also gain valuable skills like scripting, animation, and camera movement.

Throughout the course, you'll work on creating a platformer game step-by-step, with the instructor guiding you through each stage. You'll download game assets, create a player character, and design enemies with AI scripting. You'll also learn how to add a UI, including a main menu and player health display, and implement game-saving features.

This course is suitable for beginners, as it provides a comprehensive introduction to the Godot game engine and its features. Even if you have no previous experience in game development, you'll be able to follow along and create your own platformer game by the end of the course.

Null Game Dev created this course. They are experienced game developers and have created many popular courses.

So, what are you waiting for? Start watching the course on the freeCodeCamp.org YouTube channel (2-hour watch).
