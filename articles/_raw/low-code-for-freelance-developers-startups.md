Low-code is a software development approach that requires little coding in order to build applications. It is made possible through a low-code platform.

We just published a course on the freeCodeCamp.org YouTube channel that will teach you how to use the Appsmith Low-Code platform. 

Ania Kubów created this course. She is a popular instructor who has published many courses both on the freeCodeCamp channel and her own YouTube channel.

In this course you will learn how to use low code tools and APIs to build a customer support dashboard. You will learn how create the dashboard using the Appsmith platform, Google Sheet API, and the Stripe API.

You will learn how to quickly build tools that many startups use by using the low-code approach.

Appsmith provided a grant that made this course possible.

When watching this course, it is helpful if you already have basic knowledge of JavaScript and HTTP request methods. However, you should still be able to follow along if you are new to the concepts because Ania will guide you step-by-step through the process.

You will create a support dashboard where you can modify customer details, browse order history, refund active orders, and manually add orders. And all this will be created with the Appsmith low-code platform.
