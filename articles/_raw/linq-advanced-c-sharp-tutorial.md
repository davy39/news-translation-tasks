Are you a C# developer looking to enhance your skills in data manipulation and querying? Do you want to learn how to query and manipulate data from various sources using the power of Language Integrated Query (LINQ)?

We are excited to introduce our latest video course on the freeCodeCamp.org YouTube channel that will teach you how to use LINQ for advanced C# data manipulation.

This comprehensive course, taught by expert developer Gavin Lon, takes you on a deep dive into the world of LINQ, exploring its capabilities and providing practical examples to help you master this powerful tool.

The course is broken up into four parts.

### Part 1 - Introduction

In this opening section, Gavin will introduce you to LINQ and its importance in C#. You will learn how to create a .NET Core Console Application and gain an understanding of extension methods, lambda expressions, and the differences between LINQ query syntax and TSQL syntax.

### Part 2 - LINQ Queries

The second part focuses on the fundamentals of LINQ queries. Gavin will walk you through creating a .NET Console Application and discuss method syntax versus query syntax. You will learn about deferred execution versus immediate execution and dive into performing inner join queries using the Join operator. Finally, you'll explore left outer join queries using the GroupJoin operator.

### Part 3 - LINQ Operators

As you progress into Part 3, Gavin will teach you about the GroupBy and ToLookup LINQ operators. You'll also learn about the All, Any, and Contains qualifier operators, as well as element operators such as FirstOrDefault, Single, and SingleOrDefault.

### Part 4 - More LINQ Operators

In the final section, you will explore more advanced LINQ operators. Gavin will cover aggregate operators (Aggregate, Average, Count, Sum, Max), generation operators (DefaultIfEmpty, Empty, Range, Repeat), and set operators (Distinct, Except, Intersect, Union). You will also delve into partitioning operators (Skip, SkipWhile, Take, TakeWhile), conversion operators (ToList, ToDictionary, ToArray), the Let and Into keywords, and projection operators (Select, SelectMany).

### Course Summary

By the end of this comprehensive course, you will have mastered the powerful features of LINQ in C#, equipping you with the skills needed to tackle complex data manipulation tasks with ease. With Gavin Lon as your guide, you'll be well on your way to becoming a LINQ expert. Don't miss out on this opportunity to elevate your C# development skills.
