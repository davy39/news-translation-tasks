freeCodeCamp just launched a major upgrade to our [JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures Certification](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures-v8/). You can now learn JavaScript by building 21 projects!

%[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D8pqkmZWc9o]

Instead of coding through a series of challenges, you will learn the fundamentals of JavaScript by building 16 practice projects + 5 certification projects. Each of the practice projects will lead you through a step by step process for building out dynamic HTML, CSS and JavaScript applications.

Also note that any older certifications you have earned will continue to remain valid going forward. 

I have created a video walkthrough demoing each of the projects that you will build throughout this course.
