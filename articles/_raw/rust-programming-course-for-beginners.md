Rust is a safe, concurrent, and practical language that guarantees memory safety and prevents runtime errors, making it increasingly popular among developers and big tech firms like Microsoft and Google. With its efficiency, growing industry demand, and robust features, learning Rust opens up exciting opportunities in systems programming and beyond.

We just posted a full beginner-friendly Rust programming course on the freeCodeCamp.org YouTube channel. The course carefully balances theory and practical exercises to give you a strong foundational understanding of this powerful and efficient language. The course was created by Arfan Zubi who is an expert in the field.

### Course Overview

The course is laid out in a user-friendly manner, with each section focusing on a specific aspect of Rust. Starting with an introduction and providing recommended learning resources, the course ensures that you will have all the tools necessary to engage with the material fully.

From understanding the basics like variables, numbers, and the binary system to complex concepts such as lifetimes and lifetime elision, you'll gradually build your knowledge through a series of focused, digestible sections. This course even covers unique features of Rust, such as ownership, borrowing, and the "Option" enum, helping you grasp the nuances that make this language so innovative.

### Rust by Practice

The most effective learning is often done by doing. This course follows the "Rust by Practice" approach, meaning that after each topic, there will be hands-on exercises for you to solve. This direct application of the concepts you've just learned will help consolidate your understanding and foster a deeper intuition of the language's workings.

### Topics Covered

Here are all the topics you will learn about in this course:

* Variables
* Numbers & Binary System
* Chars, Bools & Unit Types
