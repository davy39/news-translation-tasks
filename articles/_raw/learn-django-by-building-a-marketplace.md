Django is a powerful and popular web framework for Python. It is used to build robust and scalable web applications with ease.

We just published a course on the freeCodeCamp.org YouTube channel that will help you learn Django through building your own online marketplace.

Stein from Code with Stein teaches this course. Stein is a very experienced course creator.

In this course, you'll learn the basics of Django by building a simple online marketplace where users can buy and sell items. You'll learn how to implement key features like authentication, communication between users, and a dashboard for managing items. Additionally, you'll learn about form handling and customizations, making it easy to add your own unique touches to your application.

The course is divided into several sections, each focusing on a specific aspect of Django and the project. In the "Setting up" section, you'll learn how to set up your development environment and get started with Django. In the "First app" section, you'll build your first Django application and get a feel for how the framework works.

The "Items" section covers the creation of the marketplace's core functionality, where users can browse and search for items. You'll learn how to create and display detailed information about each item, including images and descriptions. In the "Signing up" and "Logging in" sections, you'll learn how to implement user authentication so that users can sign up and log into your marketplace.

In the "Adding items" section, you'll learn how to let users add their own items to the marketplace. The "Dashboard" section covers the creation of a dashboard where users can manage their items, including the ability to delete, edit, and search for items. Finally, in the "Communication" section, you'll learn how to implement communication between users, so that they can ask questions and make offers on items.

This video course is perfect for beginners who are looking to learn Django and build their own online marketplace. The course covers all the basics you need to get started and will give you the foundation you need to create your own unique web applications with Django.
