Securing modern web applications is an important skill for any developer, and a foundational part of this is understanding how to manage user access.

We just posted new course on the [freeCodeCamp.org](http://freeCodeCamp.org) that will teach you about authentication and authorization in [ASP.NET](http://ASP.NET) applications, two concepts that are often confused but are fundamentally different. Ervis Trupja developed this course.

Before we can control who can do what, we first have to know who they are. This is where authentication comes in. Think of authentication as checking a user's ID card. It's the process of verifying a user's identity by checking their credentials, such as a username and password.

Once a user's identity is confirmed, authorization determines what they're allowed to do. It's like a bouncer at a club checking if your wristband gives you access to the VIP section. Authorization verifies a user's roles or permissions to ensure they can access specific resources or perform certain actions.

This comprehensive course is great for anyone looking to build secure, robust [ASP.NET](http://ASP.NET) applications. You'll gain practical, hands-on experience covering a wide range of topics:

* Setting up Identity tables using Entity Framework Core.
    
* Configuring JWTs in your `Startup.cs` file.
    
* Creating a dedicated Authentication controller.
    
* Registering and logging in new users.
    
* Generating and managing access and refresh tokens.
    
* Implementing role-based authorization to control access to different parts of your application.
