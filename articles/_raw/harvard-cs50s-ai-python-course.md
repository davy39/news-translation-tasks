Harvard University's CS50 is one of the most popular beginner computer science courses in the world. And Harvard also has versions of CS50 with different focusses, all perfect for beginners.

We just released Harvard CS50's Introduction to Artificial Intelligence with Python on the freeCodeCamp.org YouTube channel. If you are new to AI, or just want a refresher on the core concepts, this is one of the best places to start.

Brian Yu teaches this course. He is a software developer and teaches many popular courses at Harvard University.

In the rapidly advancing landscape of technology, one term stands out like a beacon of innovation: Artificial Intelligence (AI). From self-driving cars to personalized recommendations, AI has become an integral part of our lives. 

If you're eager to explore the inner workings of AI and discover the magic behind technologies like game-playing engines, handwriting recognition, and machine translation, you're in luck. 

Welcome to **CS50’s Introduction to Artificial Intelligence with Python**, a groundbreaking course that demystifies the concepts and algorithms shaping modern AI, brought to you by the freeCodeCamp.org YouTube channel and taught by the renowned Brian Yu.

This course explores the concepts and algorithms at the foundation of modern artificial intelligence, diving into the ideas that give rise to technologies like game-playing engines, handwriting recognition, and machine translation.

You'll gain exposure to the theory behind graph search algorithms, classification, optimization, reinforcement learning, and other topics in artificial intelligence and machine learning as they incorporate them into their own Python programs. Also, this course has been updated for 2023 to include an in-depth section on large language models.
