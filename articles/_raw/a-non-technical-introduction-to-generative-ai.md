If you want to learn about the concepts around generative AI without getting bogged down with the technical details, we have a great course for you. We just published a course on the freeCodeCamp.org YouTube channel that is a non-technical intro to generative AI. This course offers a broad exploration of generative AI, making it accessible to both programmers and newcomers alike. Abdul from 1littlecoder developed this course.

## Course Overview

The course begins with a quick introduction to generative AI, followed by a comparison of AI's past and present. You'll learn why generative AI is possible now, and explore some lesser-known aspects of the technology.

Abdul discusses the concept of decentralized AI and examine LLM (Large Language Model) APIs. You'll gain a systemic understanding of different levels of LLM applications, including Q&A systems, chatbots, RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) solutions, and how large language models can be used for downstream natural language processing tasks and the development of intelligent AI agents.

Finally, the course explores the potential of large language model operating systems, providing a comprehensive look at where generative AI has been, where it is now, and its future implications.

## Course Sections

Here are the sections covered in this course.

* Generative AI Quick Intro
