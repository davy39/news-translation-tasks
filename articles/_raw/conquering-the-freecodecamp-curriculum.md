I Love Challenges! They keep me going. They motivate me. They help me become a better version of myself!

Over the past 2 years I've been doing multiple "crazy" challenges.   
  
I started in September 2018 with the **run everyday for 365 days** challenge. I completed this challenge and even did a little extra, ending up with **422 consecutive days of running**! I also uploaded a photo to my personal Facebook page every day. Social proof - this helped me to keep going.

Last year, considering that I'm also a programmer, I thought to do some sort of programming challenge. #100DaysOfCode is cool but it wasn't at the level I was looking for... I wanted something bigger! So...  
  
I started and completed the **[#100Days100Projects](https://www.florin-pop.com/blog/2019/09/100-days-100-projects)** challenge, creating one project every single day for 100 days. People really enjoyed it! ?  
  
Then, I started [my YouTube channel](https://youtube.com/florinpop) and I planned to "go big or go home" with it. So I thought... ?

"I have to find something big. Something interesting...  
I have to create content. A LOT of content!"   
(at this point you are probably used to my way of thinking already ?)  
  
So... This year on Jan 1st I started the **[#31Days31Videos](https://www.florin-pop.com/blog/created-a-video-a-day-for-a-month/)** challenge and alongside the 31 videos that I created, I also did **11 Live Streams** bringing the total up to 42 videos in a month.  
  
Pretty crazy. But fun, a lot of fun! ?

### The next challenge

So as you can see... I love challenges! ?  
  
And now I've been thinking...   
  
"What should I do next? Something bigger... Something crazier...   
I want to help the developer community more. I want to create more content!" ?

And then it hit me. ?

What if...  
  
...wait for it...  
  
...wait for it...  
  
What if I'll go over **freeCodeCamp's entire curriculum** in a **series of Live Streams** on [my YouTube channel](https://youtube.com/florinpop)? ?

That'll be amazing, right? (And crazy at the same time! ?)

Let me explain this idea to you.

There are currently **6 certifications** in the freeCodeCamp curriculum:

1. Responsive Web Design
2. JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures
3. Front End Libraries
4. Data Visualization
5. APIs and Microservices
6. Information Security and Quality Assurance

My plan is to start from scratch (with a clean freeCodeCamp profile) and go through the entire curriculum, conquering one certification at a time.

It will all be done in a series of Live Streams. At the end the videos will be uploaded to the channel for those who missed the Live Streams or for those you want to rewatch them later.

I already created a [playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLgBH1CvjOA62oNEVgz-dECiCZCE_Q3ZFH) where I'm going to add all the recorded Live Streams. Also there you'll be able to find the planned ones for the future in case you want to follow along.  
  
I'm also going to announce everything on Twitter so make sure you [follow me](https://twitter.com/florinpop1705) there if you want stay up-to-date with my progress.  
  
I also have a [Discord server](https://discord.gg/qSse3Ey) where you can join if you want to follow along and chat with others which are doing the challenge too.
