Data Analysis is an in-demand field. We are hosting a free 6-week [live course on our YouTube channel](https://youtu.be/EsDFiZPljYo), starting Saturday, August 15th at 8:30 AM PST.

In this beginner-friendly course, called "Data Analysis with Python: Zero to Pandas", you will be able to ask questions live and build real world projects. You will get a coding-first introduction to data analysis. The course is taught using live interactive Jupyter notebooks and you will be able to follow along and experiment while learning all the key data analysis concepts.

This course is taught in by [Aakash N S](https://twitter.com/aakashns). He is the co-founder and CEO of Jovian.ml, a project management and collaboration platform for machine learning. Aakash will be teaching both an [English](https://youtu.be/EsDFiZPljYo) and [Hindi](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YV0_puRO1u4) version of the course.

Participants will receive weekly assignments and work on a project with real-world datasets to test their skills. 

## Syllabus

The course is divided into 5 modules, and will be taught over 5 weeks via video lectures and interactive Jupyter notebooks. Each lecture will be around 2 hours long.
