Redux is a JavaScript library for managing application state. It is most commonly used with React, but can be used with other JavaScript frameworks as well.

Redux Toolkit is a set of tools that helps simplify Redux development. It includes utilities for creating and managing Redux stores, as well as for writing Redux actions and reducers.
