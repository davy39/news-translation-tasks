On this week's episode of the podcast, I interview Eamonn Cottrell. He's a software engineer who also runs a local chain of coffee shops in Knoxville. Eamonn taught himself to code using freeCodeCamp. And he's since published 37 freeCodeCamp tutorials on productivity and automation using spreadsheets.

We talk about:

* Eamonn’s love of coffee and how he bought VHS tapes to learn latte art
    
* How he finds time to expand his skills in between running coffee shops and ultra-marathoning
    
* How he used spreadsheets to automate the logistics of running coffee shops
    
* How he balances being a musician and writer with the practical realities of providing for a family of 6
    

Can you guess what song I'm playing in the intro?

CORRECTION: Vincent van Gogh was supported by his younger brother – not his brother in-law. van Gogh never married so he never had a brother in law. I'm not sure why I thought that. Also, he seems to have sold more than one painting in his life (as many of us were taught in school), but nowhere near enough paintings to support himself as an artist.
