Full stack development is a term used to describe the process of developing a complete website or application from start to finish. A full stack developer is a web developer who can work on all parts of a website or application, from the back-end code that powers the site to the front-end user interface.

We just published a video course on the freeCodeCamp.org YouTube channel that will teach you the technologies you need to know for full stack development.

Tomi Tokko and I worked together to develop this course. We both have a ton of experience with the technologies taught in this course. 

A full stack developer is responsible for the entire process of developing a website or application, from start to finish. This includes everything from designing the user interface to writing the code that makes the site or app work.

A full stack developer must have a deep understanding of both frontend and backend web development. They must be able to code in a variety of programming languages, as well as have a strong understanding of how different web technologies work together.

In this course, you will first learn the basics of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Then, you will learn how to put everything together to create a frontend movie search app. Finally, you will learn how to create a backend API to create movie reviews and connect the frontend to the backend. The backend uses Node.js, Express, and MongoDB.

### What's the difference between frontend and backend development?

Frontend development focuses on the user interface and experience of a website or application. It concerns the look and feel of the site, as well as the code that makes it work.

Backend development focuses on the backend code that powers a website or application. It concerns the server-side code that makes the site or app work.

### What skills are required for full stack development?

Full stack developers must have a deep understanding of both front-end and back-end web development. They must be able to code in a variety of programming languages, as well as have a strong understanding of how different web technologies work together.

In this course, you will learn these important technologies:

**HTML**  
HTML is the standard markup language for creating web pages. A full stack developer must have a strong understanding of HTML in order to create user interfaces that are both effective and easy to use.

**CSS**  
CSS is a style sheet language that is used to style HTML markup. A full stack developer must have a strong understanding of CSS in order to create attractive and user-friendly websites and applications.

**JavaScript**  
JavaScript is a programming language that is used to create interactive web pages. A full stack developer must have a strong understanding of JavaScript in order to create websites and applications that are both dynamic and user-friendly.

**Node.js**  
Node.js is a JavaScript runtime environment that allows you to run JavaScript code outside of a browser.  There are a variety of programming languages that a developer can use to create the backend. But it is common to use Node.js and JavaScript.

**MongoDB**  
MongoDB is a database that is often used to store data for websites and applications. A full stack developer must have a strong understanding of how to use databases in order to create websites and applications that are both effective and efficient.
