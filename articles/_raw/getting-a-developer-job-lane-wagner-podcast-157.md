Quincy mentions the number of engineers graduating every year from Indian and Chinese universities (including computer science majors, which is usually the most popular engineering degree). It's hard to find exact numbers but...

* India: more than 1 million engineering graduates / year
    
* China: more than 1 million engineering graduates / year
    
* US: only about 200,000 engineering graduates / year
