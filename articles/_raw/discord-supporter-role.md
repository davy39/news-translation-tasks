If you have donated to support freeCodeCamp's efforts, you can now claim a special Supporter role in our [Discord community](https://discord.gg/KVUmVXA).

### Claim Your Role

In any channel within our Discord server, type `/supporter` and you should see a command window pop up.

!["/supporter" has been entered into the Discord chat box. A list is positioned above the chat box, indicating "Commands Matching /supporter". CamperChan's "/supporter" command is listed and highlighted.](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1712942511612/54b1e532-4246-416c-8f11-b8c96d901b22.png align="center")

Click CamperChan's `/supporter` command, and enter the email address **associated with your freecodecamp.org/learn account**.

![Discord chat box with CamperChan's /supporter command populated. The email input field has been focused, with the text "naomi@freecodecamp.org" entered.](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1712942602136/38acb38d-e617-47c8-a8e9-3ad40056827d.png align="center")

Then, hit enter to submit the command and you should see a success message! You'll now have the role with access to the supporter-only channels.

![CamperChan /supporter command response: "Congrats! You now have the supporter role, with access to special channels."](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1712943254909/988af1b4-4755-49e5-952a-9008730f6634.png align="center")

### Error Messages

There are a few error messages you may encounter when claiming this role. For any of these messages, please ping Naomi directly in the server to assist you.

#### Already Have Role

![CamperChan /supporter command response: "You have already claimed the supporter role."](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1712942696023/81047dac-769c-48fb-b12d-c008bb24e6c4.png align="center")

This error message means you have already been assigned the Supporter role in the Discord server.

#### Record for Discord Server Exists

![CamperChan /supporter command response: "A supporter record already exists on your Discord account. If you believe this is an error, please contact Naomi."](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1712942812020/41aae705-cb11-4360-9488-6eb494284e99.png align="center")

This error message means your Discord account has already been granted the Supporter role previously, but you have somehow lost it (for example by leaving the server and rejoining later).

Naomi will need to reset the database entry for you.

#### Record for Email Exists

![CamperChan /supporter command response: "A supporter record already exists on your email. If you believe this is an error, please contact Naomi."](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1712943013577/c0bd880f-3d30-4fdf-82e5-5633d2d58646.png align="center")

This means your email address has already been used by another Discord account to claim the Supporter role. Naomi will give you instructions on how to verify ownership of the email address.

#### Not a Supporter

![CamperChan /supporter command response: "You do not appear to be actively supporting freeCodeCamp at this time. If you believe this is an error, please contact Naomi."](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1712942928427/5fc4ada9-b3e6-4a05-baf7-1037957b5c8d.png align="center")

This means your curriculum account has not been flagged as having donated. Reach out to Naomi, and she will provide you instructions so she can fix that - make sure to have your latest donation receipt ready.

#### No freeCodeCamp account

![CamperChan /supporter command response: "There does not appear to be a learn account associated with example@naomi.lgbt. If you believe this is an error, please contact Naomi."](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1712943178704/69a6f828-f495-4c0e-a63d-2a36d7dc8da3.png align="center")

This means the email address you entered does not have a curriculum account associated with it. Double check the spelling, and make sure you are using the email you use to sign in at freecodecamp.org

### Thank You
