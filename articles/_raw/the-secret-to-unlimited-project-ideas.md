As a developer, practice is vital to your continued professional success.

The web moves fast. Just a year or two of contentment could leave you eating JavaScript's dust.

Yet many developers, regardless of experience, frantically ask: "Which project should I do?"

![which-project-should-i-do](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2019/08/which-project-should-i-do.jpeg)

...only to receive these cryptic answers.

In hopes of preventing that, I'd like to share some advice that's been very beneficial to me.

## Copy–until you can create
Consider the following quote...

> Good artists copy; great artists steal. - Pablo Picasso

This doesn't mean rob your parents.

It means, _while you're practicing_, don't bother with original ideas. Just copy something and focus on perfecting your technique!

You can rewrite the source code line-by-line, do it totally independently, or somewhere in-between.

## Everyone's Doing It
Aspiring artists and authors copy all the time. Whether it's redrawing or rewriting, mimicking a famous piece is a mind-opening exercise. You get to immerse yourself in the craft and not worry about formulating a good idea. All the focus goes toward improving your skills.

This applies to programming too! Myself and many other developers copy open source repos just to learn how they work. You discover techniques you might've never encountered before.

In his inspirational Medium Clap article, Emmanuel Ohans took this principle to the extreme. He figured out how to design his own project after copying countless Codrops repos.

It's not about plagiarizing original works–it's about improving your technique and drawing inspiration from others.

## How You Can Do It
Find a project you'd like to copy, then pick one option...

1. Copy its source code line-by-line
2. Look at source code only when you're stuck
3. Recreate it 100% by yourself
4. Just do something!

All the choices are valid and beneficial. As you complete the project, research any syntax/patterns you find confusing.

## Original = Coding last
If you only practice through original ideas, this will be your workflow.

1. Thinking of something
2. Research
3. Planning
4. Marketing
5. Design
6. Development (**The very last step**)

Looks pretty wasteful to me, unless you're running a startup company.

## Copying = Coding first
For the ones who _just want to code_, consider this process instead.

1. Code an existing app that interests you

That's it! The process is now aligned with our goals. Instead of developing at the very end, we're now developing all the way through.

The idea, research, planning, and design are all taken care of. We can focus on the good stuff, unlike poor Harold here.

He'll never improve because he's stuck in the idea phase. Don't make his mistake! Spend your resources on _practicing_ instead of idea-making.

If that's your goal, at least. ?

## Want Free Coaching?
If you'd like to schedule a **free** 15-30 minute call to discuss Front-End development questions regarding code, interviews, career, or anything else [follow me on Twitter and DM me](https://twitter.com/yazeedBee).

After that if you enjoy our first meeting, we can discuss an ongoing coaching relationship that'll help you reach your Front-End development goals!
