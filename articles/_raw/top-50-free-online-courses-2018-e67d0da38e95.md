I am back with an updated list of the best free online courses and massive open online courses **(**MOOCs) of all time. Class Central [published the Top 50 MOOCs](https://www.class-central.com/report/top-moocs/) for the first time in July of 2016 and [refreshed](https://www.class-central.com/report/top-50-moocs-2017-edition/) it again last year. Between each iteration of this list, universities and MOOC providers have added a couple thousand new courses and Class Central users have written just as many new reviews.

Now there are over 10,000+ MOOCs from over 800 universities worldwide. This can be daunting to the millions of learners around the world who have never done an online course before.

That’s why I came up with a list of _Top 50 MOOCs of All Time_ based on **thousands of reviews** written by Class Central users.

In providing a small but well-reviewed list of courses, my hope is that new learners will not be overwhelmed when entering the MOOC space. Reviews will help new learners figure out if a course is right for them, and whether they will have a great first experience.

#### Our methodology for creating this list

Class Central has thousands of reviews written by our users, and we were able to sort these courses by the Bayesian average of their ratings.

Then we removed all the courses with less than 35 reviews (the low threshold helps smaller providers to compete on quality) and courses for which we had doubts whether they would be offered again. If a course has multiple parts, we only included the first part in the Top 50.

#### The best courses

The Top 50 MOOCs will be updated regularly as new courses are added and we receive new reviews. Better yet, you can also _Follow_ the Top 50 MOOCs on its special [collection page](https://www.class-central.com/collection/top-free-online-courses) (look for the “follow top 50” button just below the title). Followers will receive a notification whenever we update the Top 50 MOOCs list.

Oh … and if you feel that a course you took deserved to be on this list but isn’t, please [find the course](https://www.class-central.com/search) on Class Central and write a review for the course.

### Class Central’s Top 50 Free Online Courses of All Time

There are a lot of usual suspects in the Top 50. Think of courses like _Learning How To Learn_, Harvard’s _CS50x_, _ModPo_, and Class Central’s [best online course of 2016](https://www.class-central.com/report/best-free-online-courses-2016/) — _Coding in your Classroom, Now!_ as well as Class Central’s [best online course of 2017](https://www.class-central.com/report/best-free-online-courses-2017/)_, Mindshift: Break Through Obstacles to Learning and Discover Your Hidden Potential._

Some of the new courses that were added to the 2018 edition include:

1. Georgetown’s _Quantum Mechanics for Everyone_ on edX
2. _The Musculoskeletal System: The Science of Staying Active into Old Age from_ Newcastle University, The University of Sheffield, and University of Liverpool on FutureLearn
3. _Preventing Dementia_ from University of Tasmania with almost 900 reviews can be considered a sequel to another Top 50 course _Understanding Dementia_
4. _Cartography,_ from ESRI
5. _Presentation skills: Designing Presentation Slides_ from Tomsk State University on Coursera. This is the first Russian university to make into Class Central’s Top 50.

The Top 50 also contains courses from prominent personalities, like _The Science of the Solar System_ by Mike Brown (AKA “Plutokiller”) and _Functional Programming Principles in Scala_ by Martin Odersky (the creator of Scala).

Here is a quick summary of the Top 50 list:

1. Coursera is the top provider with 28 courses in the Top 50, and edX is second with 10 courses
2. Stanford, Penn, and University of Cape Town each have three courses in the Top 50.
3. The list includes courses from 37 universities, a research institute (Santa Fe) and one company (ESRI), of which 16 universities (down from 22 last year) are in the US
4. Barbara Oakley and Terry Sejnowski, the instructors of the most popular MOOC in the world, have two courses in the top 50. Their new course _Mindshift_ joins _Learning How To Learn_ in the top 50.
