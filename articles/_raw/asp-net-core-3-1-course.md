ASP.NET Core is an open source web-development framework for building web apps on the .NET platform. While originally only for Windows, it is now available on macOS and Linux as well.

We've released a 3 hour course on the freeCodeCamp.org YouTube channel so you can learn ASP.NET Core 3.1. The course is for beginners, but it is expected that you have some knowledge of C#. (If you want to learn C#, check out [this great C# course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GhQdlIFylQ8).)

In this course you will first learn about the history and basics of ASP.NET Core. Then you will learn how to build a small book list application with CRUD operations. You will learn how to use the Entity Framework for integration with a database with ASP.NET Core Razor Pages.

You will also learn how to build a book list application using ASP.NET MVC and see how to use DataTables with API Calls in a Razor Project.

This course was developed by Bhrugen Patel. Watch it below or [on the freeCodeCamp.org YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5cnZ-gZy2I).
