Project 2 from JavaScript Algos and DS Certification.

We're continuing our journey through the FreeCodeCamp JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures Certification! Last project was the **Palindrome Checker**, the first entry in our series. You can [check it out here](https://youtu.be/XV5OCibNpLI).

Now we're doing the **Roman Numeral Converter**. Our job is to take a given number and turn it into a roman numeral.

This video covers:

* What roman numerals are
* How to convert between them and our number system
* A shortcut for converting special-case roman numerals
* What accumulators are (useful for later JavaScript)
* An efficient solution with linear runtime O(n)
* and more!

You can watch [the full video on my YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_ISxHcg-RM).

Here's a link to [the entire playlist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XV5OCibNpLI&list=PLehRZjGCVhQLTWPN8mTo3rlRDQff9fCmT) as well.
