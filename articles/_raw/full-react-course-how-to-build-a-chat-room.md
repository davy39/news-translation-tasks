In this video course, you'll learn React by building a chat room app.

By the end of the video, you'll have a solid understanding of React.js and have your very own chat room app that you can use to chat with your friends.

This course uses the Chatkit API, so you won't have worry about doing any back-end coding. And at any time during the video, you can get a working version of the code and experiment with it using Scrimba.

You can watch the full video on [the freeCodeCamp.org YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFNHerJqvFw) (90 minute watch).‌
