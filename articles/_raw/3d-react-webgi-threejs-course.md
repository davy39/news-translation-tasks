Are you interested in learning how to build a 3D animation using React?

We just published a full course on the freeCodeCamp.org YouTube channel that will teach you how to add 3D elements into your React websites.

Slobodan Gajic created this course. He is a senior fullstack developer and popular course creator.

Throughout the course, you'll learn how to use technologies such as WebGi (powered by Three.js) and GSAP to create a stunning 3D animation. The course is broken down into several chapters, each of which covers a specific topic related to building 3D animations in React.

In the first chapter, you'll be introduced to the course and learn how to set up your project. From there, you'll move on to building website navigation and creating a jumbotron. You'll also learn how to build a sound section and a display section.

One of the most exciting parts of the course is when you learn how to find and load 3D models into your website using WebGi. You'll then learn how to build a WebGi viewer component, which will allow you to display 3D models on your website.

After that, you'll dive into animating 3D models using GSAP scroll animation. You'll also learn how to implement 3D model preview mode and optimize your 3D animation for mobile phones.

Finally, you'll build a production-ready website and upload it to Netlify. By the end of the course, you'll have all the skills you need to build a beautiful 3D animation in React.

The course is suitable for both beginners and advanced developers, and it includes links to all the necessary resources, including the final website, the starter project, and the full source code.
