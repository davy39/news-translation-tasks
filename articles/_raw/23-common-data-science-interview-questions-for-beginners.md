In 2012, Harvard Business Review named data science the sexiest job of the 21st century. But if you want to get a job as a data scientist, you'll need to go through a tough interview process.

During data science job interviews, the interviewer will likely ask questions from different data science topics such as statistics, programming, data analysis, data pre-processing, and modeling. 

Your skills will be put to the test, and you need to prepare yourself if you want to get through the interview successfully.

In this article, I have compiled a list of common data science interview questions with tips on how you can answer them. I've also shared a list of resources that will help you learn more about the specific topic presented in each interview question.

# Data Science Interview Questions

## Final Thoughts on Data Science Interview Questions

Reviewing these common data science interview questions will actually boost your confidence during the interview. 

Don't expect the interviewer to ask you all questions mentioned in this article. But most of the interview questions will come from the same topics.

For example, instead of asking "**Explain the difference between supervised and unsupervised learning**", the interviewer can ask you to “**Explain some supervised learning algorithms and how they learn from the data**”.

If you are interested in learning and reading more data science interview questions, take your time and read through [these](https://www.springboard.com/blog/data-science/data-science-interview-questions/) [additional](https://huyenchip.com/ml-interviews-book/) [resources](https://hackernoon.com/160-data-science-interview-questions-415s3y2a) for inspiration.

And don't forget to practice your coding skills because some questions during the interview require you to code the solution.

I hope these data science interview questions will help you prepare for your interview and I wish you the best of luck in your data science career.
