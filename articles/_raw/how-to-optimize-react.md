React makes it easy to build UIs, but building fast React apps is a different skill altogether.

We just posted a hands-on, real-world React Performance Optimization course on the freeCodeCamp.org YouTube channel. You’ll learn how React actually re-renders, why your app slows down, and which performance patterns truly matter in production. Tapas created this course.

This video is about knowing what to optimize, when to optimize, and how to do it right.

Here are the sections in this course:

* Performance Patterns
    
* What’s in Part 1?
    
* Re-Rendering in React
    
* Memoization
    
* The memo()
    
* The useCallback()
    
* the useMemo()
    
* The Derived State
    
* Debouncing
    
* Throttling
    
* Tasks from Part 1
    
* Advanced Patterns
    
* What’s in Part 2?
    
* React Compiler
    
* Lazy Loading & Suspense
    
* Component Isolation
    
* Context Optimizations
    
* Virtualization
    
* Concurrency and useTransition()
    
* Deferred Value
    
* List and Keys
    
* Tools
    
* Tasks from Part 2
