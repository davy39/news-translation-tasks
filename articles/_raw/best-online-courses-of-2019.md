By Dhawal Shah

As we do each year, [Class Central](https://www.classcentral.com/) has tallied the best courses of the previous year, based on thousands of learner reviews. (Here are the rankings from [2015](https://www.classcentral.com/report/best-free-online-courses-2015/), [2016](https://www.classcentral.com/report/best-free-online-courses-2016/), [2017](https://www.classcentral.com/report/best-free-online-courses-2017/), and [2018](https://www.classcentral.com/report/best-free-online-courses-2018/).) 

The methodology is simple. I made a list of all the courses that were offered for the first time in 2019, and then ranked the courses by the Bayesian average of their ratings. 

More than 2,400 courses were offered for the first time in 2019. Class Central received 20,000+ reviews in 2019 alone. Overall, Class Central learners have written more than 70,000+ reviews, and based on this data, we also publish a [best online courses](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/best-online-courses/) of all time.

The courses below are the thirty most highly ranked on Class Central, based on the Bayesian average of the thousands of reviews that came in during the year for courses released in 2019.

## **5 Highlights**

1. Surprisingly, the top two courses in the list are not from the major MOOC platforms, but independent stand-alone courses.
2. [_Understanding Multiple Sclerosis_](https://www.classcentral.com/course/independent-understanding-multiple-sclerosis-ms-13338) from the University of Tasmania is the #1 course of 2019. It’s produced by the same team behind the extremely popular and highly rated, [_Understanding Dementia_](https://www.classcentral.com/course/independent-understanding-dementia-981). It’s followed by a course in Italian, by the University of Urbino: [_Umano Digitale_](https://www.classcentral.com/course/independent-umano-digitale-13499) or Digital Human. It’s taught by Alessandro Bogliolo, who previously also had a course that made it into our 2016 rankings.
3. With 4 courses, the [University of Leeds](https://www.classcentral.com/university/leeds) tops the list, followed by [Princeton University](https://www.classcentral.com/university/princeton), [Galileo University](https://www.classcentral.com/university/galileo), [HKUST](https://www.classcentral.com/university/hkust) and the [British Council](https://www.classcentral.com/institution/british-council) with two courses each. Organizations like [World Bank](https://www.classcentral.com/institution/worldbank) and [British Council](https://www.classcentral.com/institution/british-council) are among MOOC makers in the ranking.
4. Although most MOOCs exist in Computer Science and Business and Management, courses from humanities and social sciences were well represented in the 2019 ranking, among them: [Academic Writing](https://www.classcentral.com/course/swayam-academic-writing-13881), [Supporting Victims of Domestic Violence](https://www.classcentral.com/course/domestic-violence-15221) and [Gender and Sexuality: Applications in Society](https://www.classcentral.com/course/edx-gender-and-sexuality-applications-in-society-12333).
5. And finally, India’s official MOOC platform [Swayam](https://www.classcentral.com/provider/swayam) makes its first appearance in our rankings with six courses.
