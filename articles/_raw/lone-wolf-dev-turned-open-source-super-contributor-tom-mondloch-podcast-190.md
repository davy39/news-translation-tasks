Tom Mondloch quit programming after he finished community college. After a few years of odd jobs, he decided to get back into programming and discovered freeCodeCamp.

He was just learning his own way, and didn't think freeCodeCamp's linear curriculum would be worth his time. But he stuck with it, got good, and ultimately started contributing to our open source project.

He's since joined freeCodeCamp's staff and archetected freeCodeCamp's entire relational database curriculum, which you can run in your browser or right inside your VS Code editor.

Tom shares tips for:

* Brushing up on your programming skills if you've taken a few years off
    
* Contributing to open source
    
* Using AI codegen tools sensibly and not relying too heavily on them
    

He also talks about the role of vocational college, his love of the outdoors, and how working remotely allows him to continue to live in small town middle America without the need to move to a big city.

News items:

1. freeCodeCamp just published this comprehensive front end development course where you build your own browser-based code editor. You can code along at home and build your own single page app development environment with tabs for editing your HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Along the way, you'll learn some intermediate JS techniques that allow for instant live preview, so you can see the results of your code changes right away.

4. Enjoy this breezy read about Cosine Similarity and the role it plays in Large Language Models. As its author, Manish, says, Cosine Similarity is “a bridge between human language and machine understanding. It allows a model to treat meaning as geometry, turning questions and answers into points in space.” Not only will you learn the math involved, you'll also see it implemented in Python code.
