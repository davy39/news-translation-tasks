TypeScript is a typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript. TypeScript provides better error checking than JavaScript. This is because TypeScript uses a static type system, which means that the type of a variable is checked before the code is executed.

We just published a 5-hour TypeScript course for beginners on the freeCodeCamp.org YouTube channel.

Hitesh Choudhary will teach you everything you need to know to get started with TypeScript. Hitesh has a YouTube channel with 750,000 subscribers and has created over 1000 tutorials.

Here are a few reasons you may want to use TypeScript instead of JavaScript:

1. TypeScript provides better error checking than JavaScript. This is because TypeScript uses a static type system, which means that the type of a variable is checked before the code is executed.
2. TypeScript can be used to develop large-scale JavaScript applications. The type system and the compiler help to organize the code and to catch errors early.
3. TypeScript code can be easily ported to other languages that support JavaScript, such as CoffeeScript or Dart.

The course has the following sections:

* Why to learn TypeScript
* TypeScript is not what you think
* How to install TypeScript
* Your first intro to TypeScript docs
* Number, boolean, and type inference
* Number, boolean, and type inference
