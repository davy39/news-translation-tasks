Python is currently one of the most [loved and in-demand programming languages](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2019). To help you get a head-start and learn the basics (and some more advanced concepts, too), here are some Python resources for you.

Keep in mind that this list is not complete. For one thing, freeCodeCamp is creating [four new Python certificates](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/python-curriculum/) in 2020! So keep an eye out for those. But for now, these are the best resources to use to start learning Python.

This list is split up into Tutorials (Python, Django, Flask, TensorFlow), Projects to build with Python (and related technologies), Videos and Courses, and other helpful resources like communities you can join. Happy learning!
