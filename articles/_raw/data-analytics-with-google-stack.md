The ability to analyze and interpret data is indispensable across many different industries. And you don't even need to buy any software to expertly analyize data.

We just posted a course on the freeCodeCamp.org YouTube channel that will teach you about data analytics through hands-on projects, leveraging a suite of free Google services. This course from Analyst Adithya offers a practical approach to understanding and applying data analytics tools.

#### Data Analysis with Google Sheets

The course starts with Google Sheets, a versatile tool that goes beyond basic spreadsheet functionalities. You will learn how to perform sophisticated data analysis tasks, manipulate data sets, and employ formulas and functions to uncover insights. Google Sheets' accessibility and user-friendly interface make it an excellent starting point for those new to data analytics, providing a solid foundation in data manipulation and analysis.

#### SQL with Google BigQuery

As you progress, you are introduced to Google BigQuery, a powerful tool for querying massive datasets using SQL (Structured Query Language). This segment of the course is designed to bridge the gap between traditional spreadsheet analysis and more advanced database management. By exploring BigQuery, you will gain proficiency in SQL, learning how to execute complex queries, join tables, and extract meaningful information from large data sets.

#### Python with Google Colab

The course then teaches Python programming with Google Colab, an environment that allows users to write and execute Python code through their browsers. This section is particularly exciting for those looking to harness the power of Python for data analysis, offering a hands-on experience with coding, data manipulation, and the application of libraries like Pandas and NumPy. Google Colab's collaborative features also introduce learners to the concept of shared, interactive computing.

#### Data Visualization with Google Looker Studio

Finally, the course ends with data visualization using Google Looker Studio (formerly known as Google Data Studio), where learners will discover how to transform their analyzed data into compelling, interactive reports and dashboards. This module emphasizes the importance of data storytelling, teaching participants how to present their findings visually to communicate insights effectively and influence decision-making.

### Conclusion

 By covering a range of Google services, the course provides a broad perspective on data analytics, ensuring that you are well-versed in various tools and methodologies.
