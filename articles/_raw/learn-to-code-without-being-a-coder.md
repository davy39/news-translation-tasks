Ever dreamt of building your own apps but felt intimidated by the complex world of programming? Or maybe you just want to quickly enhance your coding output?

We just posted a course on the freeCodeCamp.org YouTube channel that will teach you how to write code with the help of AI. 

Guil Hernandez teaches this course. Guil is not just an expert in tech – he's a passionate teacher committed to transforming lives through technology. Guil will teach how AI can help with creation, experimentation, and idea realization.

## What You'll Learn

In this course, you will embark on a journey from building simple projects to tackling increasingly sophisticated ones. You will learn how to use AI tools like ChatGPT to help with the technical aspects of coding, allowing you to focus on the creative side of app development. This approach will enable you to develop your programming skills progressively. 

The course covers front-end development using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and is designed to help even those with no prior coding experience. 

By the end of the course, you will have completed a variety of mini-projects, acquired new skills, and laid a solid foundation for future development with AI.

## Course Overview

The course is divided into three main sections, each designed to progressively enhance your skills:

### Section 1: Launch Your First Projects

In the first section, you will be introduced to the world of AI coding. You will start by building basic components like a login button and then progress to more complex projects such as a website hero section, subscription signup form, and even a drum kit app. 

This section is about getting your hands dirty with actual projects and learning by doing.

### Section 2: Advanced AI Projects

The second section takes you deeper into the world of AI-assisted development. Here, you will engage in more complex projects, such as building a 'Whac-a-Mole' style game and creating a personal homepage. You will also learn about deploying your projects using tools like GitHub and Netlify. 

This section is about refining your skills and expanding your project portfolio.

### Section 3: Database-Powered Applications

In the final section, you will dive into the world of database-powered applications. You will learn about Firebase, how to set it up, and how to integrate it into your projects. 

Projects in this section include a compliment generator, lunch break poll, and a road wallet app, which will help you understand the practical applications of databases in development.

## Conclusion

This course is ideal for anyone who wants to dive into the world of app development without prior coding experience. It focuses on helping you bring your ideas to life, using AI as a tool to help you with the complex parts of coding. You will gain invaluable problem-solving skills and become adept at troubleshooting and debugging.
