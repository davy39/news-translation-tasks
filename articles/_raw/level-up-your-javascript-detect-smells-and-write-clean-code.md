We just posted course on freeCodeCamp.org YouTube channel that will teach you how to transform messy, hard-to-maintain JavaScript code into clean, readable, and professional-quality code that scales.

This course was developed by Tapas Adhikary. He'll help you understand what Code Smell is, why it matters, and how to refactor step-by-step using proven clean code principles, real examples, and modern tooling like ESLint + Prettier. You'll learn to write code that is maintainable, elegant, and future-proof.

The course covers:

* What Code Smell means and how to detect it
    
* Why clean code matters in real-world software development
    
* Common categories of Code Smells with JavaScript examples
    
* How to refactor smelly code into clean, readable code
    
* Practical demo of ESLint + Prettier for automated clean-up
    
* Best practices, patterns, and mindset for writing maintainable code
    
* Assignments and next steps to continue your clean code journey
