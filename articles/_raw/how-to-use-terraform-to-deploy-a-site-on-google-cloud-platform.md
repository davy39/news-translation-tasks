Modern cloud technologies have revolutionized the way we develop and deploy applications. But managing complex infrastructure can still be a daunting task, especially when working at scale. The solution? Infrastructure as Code (IaC) — an approach that brings programming paradigms to infrastructure management, thereby enhancing efficiency, repeatability, and agility.

With that in mind, we're excited to introduce a new course that combines IaC with the power of Terraform and Google Cloud Platform (GCP). The course is now live on the freeCodeCamp.org YouTube channel. This course is designed to equip you with the skills to efficiently deploy a website to the GCP using Terraform, an industry-leading IaC tool.

Rishab Kumar created this course. He is a Developer Evangelist at Twilio and is an excellent teacher.

Here's a snapshot of the course:

1. **Introduction to Project**: Get an overview of the project you'll be working on throughout the course — deploying a website to the GCP.
2. **Setting Up Google Cloud Platform (GCP)**: Navigate through the GCP setup process, understanding key features of this powerful cloud service provider.
3. **Installing Terraform and Setting Up the Directory**: Dive into the Terraform setup, learn how to install it, and set up the directory for your project.
4. **Writing Terraform Code**: Master the art of writing effective Terraform code for managing infrastructure.
5. **Deploying Google Storage Bucket to GCP**: Implement your first deployment — a Google Storage Bucket — to the GCP using Terraform.
6. **Adding Other Resources in Terraform**: Expand your Terraform skills by learning to add more resources, taking your deployment capabilities to the next level.
7. **Custom Domain Configuration**: Find out how to configure a custom domain for your website, adding a professional touch.
8. **Deploying Remaining Resources to GCP**: Deploy the rest of the resources to the GCP, consolidating all the concepts you've learned so far.
9. **Terraform Destroy and gitignore**: Finally, understand how to safely de-provision infrastructure using 'Terraform Destroy' and learn about the role of '.gitignore' in a Terraform project.

This course is an excellent opportunity to tap into the transformative power of IaC. Whether you're a beginner or an experienced developer looking to expand your skillset, this course provides a hands-on, practical approach to mastering Terraform and GCP.

Watch the full course on the freeCodeCamp.org YouTube channel (1-hour watch).
