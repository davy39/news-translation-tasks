The freeCodeCamp community just published our new [A2 English for Developers certification](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/a2-english-for-developers/). You can now sit for the exam to earn the free verified certification, which you can add to your résumé, CV, or LinkedIn profile.

## How Does the A2 English for Developers Certification Work?

In this English for Developers Certification, you'll learn the essentials of English communication. This will follow the A2 level of the Common European Framework of Reference (CEFR). And we've focused on vocabulary that is particularly useful for developers.

The first half of the curriculum will help you get comfortable with English grammar and usage. It will give you tons of hands-on practice. You'll learn basics like introducing yourself, making small talk, and discussing your work.

Topics include learning greetings at the office, introductions in online meetings, conversation starters in the break room, discussing workdays and tasks, morning or evening routines, describing current projects, sharing educational and professional backgrounds, and talking about hobbies and interests. Each section has a downward arrow icon indicating expansion.](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1764686677811/cf3ce628-e000-44be-a778-6f7bdb2685f3.png align="center")

In the second half, you'll practice vocabulary specific to software development. You'll learn how to describe code, discuss tech trends, and participate in meetings.

![A list of seven learning topics with dropdown arrows: 1) Roles and Responsibilities, 2) Preferences and Motivations, 3) Trends in Technology, 4) Clarifying Information, 5) Programming Vocabulary, 6) Code-related Concepts, 7) Tech Trends and Updates.](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1764686758073/4c4aa5fa-7455-49c3-9c6a-43169d46fe3e.png align="center")

Each section in this curriculum follows a unique theme, contains several dialogues, and is filled with hundreds of interactive tasks that will help you develop your English skills.

These tasks will introduce new vocabulary, teach grammar, or review concepts that you’ll need to know in order to understand what the characters from the dialogues are saying.

Each task will have an accompanying question that will help you practice the content.

The curriculum also has fill-in-the-blank questions that will help you practice writing in English.

![An animated character with glasses and a beard is standing in a modern office with wooden floors and colorful furniture. A fill-in-the-blank question at the bottom asks, "That's awesome! _____ time have you spent on it?"

This entire A2-level curriculum includes 105 different dialogues recorded by native English speakers. Each dialogue is designed to build your vocabulary and boost your confidence when speaking in a professional tech setting.

![Two animated characters, Sophie and James, are in an office setting discussing a cybersecurity project. Sophie asks James about his project.

Once you’ve completed the certification, you’ll be able to take the A2 English for Developers exam. This exam contains 48 grammar questions, 36 listening questions, and 24 reading questions. All the questions are based on what’s covered in the certification course.

You can take the exam by using our new open source exam environment. The freeCodeCamp community designed this exam environment tool with two goals: respecting your privacy while also making it harder for people to cheat.

Once you download the app to your laptop or desktop, you can take the exam.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Is all of this really free?

Yes. freeCodeCamp has always been free, and we’ve now offered free verified certifications for more than a decade. These exams are just the latest expansion to our community’s free learning resources.

### Can I study the certification courses in languages other than English?

We aim to make every course available in all supported languages on freeCodeCamp. Check your account settings to see if the course you are studying is already offered in your preferred language.

### What language skills does the curriculum cover?

The languages courses currently cover listening, reading, and writing. We have plans to add speaking later on.

### Are the audio in the language courses and exams recorded by native language speakers?

Yes. All the audios present in the language courses were recorded by native speakers of that language.

### I am Deaf or hard of hearing. Can I still study the language courses?

Yes! All audio lesson have closed captions and transcripts available for reading.

### I am blind or have limited vision, and use a screen reader. Can I still study the language courses?

Yes! freeCodeCamp courses are designed to be accessible, and you can study the language courses using a screen reader. If you run into any accessibility issues, you can report them on our GitHub repository so the community can address them.

### What are the letters and numbers beside the certification name? (For example: A1, A2, B1)

These labels refer to the CEFR levels, which is an international framework used to describe language proficiency. A1 and A2 represent beginner levels, B1 and B2 represent intermediate levels, and C1 and C2 represent advanced levels.

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1765475620837/6822cf7c-d05f-4a5c-8e8a-994c540ed369.png align="center")

Each level indicates the skills and knowledge you are expected to have at that stage of your language learning journey.

### What prevents people from just cheating on the exams?

Our goal is to strike a balance between preventing cheating and respecting people's right to privacy.

We've implemented a number of reliable, yet non-invasive, measures to help prevent people from cheating on freeCodeCamp's exams:

1. For each exam, we have a massive bank of questions and potential answers to those questions. Each time a person attempts an exam, they'll see only a small, randomized sampling of these questions.
    
2. We only allow people to attempt an exam one time per week. This reduces their ability to "brute force" the exam.
    
3. We have security in place to validate exam submissions and prevent man-in-the-middle attacks or manipulation of the exam environment.
    
4. We manually review each passing exam for evidence of cheating. Our exam environment produces tons of metrics for us to draw from.
    

We take cheating, and any form of academic dishonesty, seriously. We will act decisively.

This said, no one's exam results will be thrown out without human review, and no one's account will be banned without warning based on a single suspicious exam result.

### Are these exams “open book” or “closed book”?

All of freeCodeCamp’s exams are “closed book”, meaning you must rely only on your mind and not outside resources.

Of course, in the real world you’ll be able to look things up. And in the real world, we encourage you to do so.

But that is not what these exams are evaluating. These exams are instead designed to test your memory of details and your comprehension of concepts.

So when taking these exams, do not use outside assistance in the form of books, notes, AI tools, or other people. Use of any of these will be considered academic dishonesty.

### Do you record my webcam, microphone, or require me to upload a photo of my personal ID?

No. We considered adding these as additional test-taking security measures. But we have less privacy-invading methods of detecting most forms of academic dishonesty.

### If the environment is open source, doesn't that make it less secure?

"Given enough eyeballs, all bugs are shallow." – Linus’s Law, formulated by Eric S. Raymond in his book *The Cathedral and the Bazaar*

Open source software projects are often more secure than their closed source equivalents. This is because a lot more people are scrutinizing the code. And a lot more people can potentially help identify bugs and other deficiencies, then fix them.

We feel confident that open source is the way to go for this exam environment system.

### How can I contribute to the Exam Environment codebase?

It's fully open source, and we'd welcome your code contributions. Please read our general [contributor onboarding documentation](https://contribute.freecodecamp.org/intro/).

Then check out the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/exam-env).

You can help by creating issues to report bugs or request features.

You can also browse open `help wanted` issues and attempt to open pull requests addressing them.

### Are the exam questions themselves open source?

For obvious exam security reasons, the exam question banks themselves are not publicly accessible. :)

These are built and maintained by freeCodeCamp's staff instructional designers.

### What happens if I have internet connectivity issues mid-exam?

If you have internet connectivity issues mid exam, the next time you try to submit an answer, you’ll be told there are connectivity issues. The system will keep prompting you to retry submitting until the connection succeeds.

### What if my computer crashes mid-exam?

If your computer crashes mid exam, you’ll be able to re-open the Exam Environment. Then, if you still have time left for your exam attempt, you’ll be able to continue from where you left off.

### Can I take exams in languages other than English?

Not yet. We’re working to add multi-lingual support in the future.

### I have completed my exam. Why can't I see my results yet?

All exam attempts are reviewed by freeCodeCamp staff before we release the results. We do this to ensure the integrity of the exam process and to prevent cheating. Once your attempt has been reviewed, you'll be notified of your results the next time you log in to freeCodeCamp.org.

### I use a keyboard instead of a mouse. Can I navigate the exams using just a keyboard?

This is a high priority for us. We hope to add keyboard navigation to the Exam Environment app soon.

### Are exams timed?

Yes, exams are timed. We err on the side of giving plenty of time to take the exam, to account for people who are non-native English speakers, or who have ADHD and other learning differences that can make timed exams more challenging.

If you have a condition that usually qualifies you for extra time on standardized exams, please email support@freecodecamp.org. We’ll review your request and see whether we can find a reasonable solution.

### What happens if I fail the exam? Can I retake it?

Yes. You get one exam attempt per week. Afterward, if you don’t pass, there is a one-week (exactly 168 hour) “cool-down” period where you cannot take any freeCodeCamp exams. This is to encourage you to study and to pace yourself.

There is no limit to the number of times you can take an exam. So if you fail, study more, practice your skills more, then try again the following week.

### Will the exam be available to take on my phone?

At this time, no. You’ll need to use a laptop or desktop to download the exam environment and take the exam. We hope to eventually offer these certification exams on iPhone and Android.

### I have a disability or health condition that is not covered here. How can I request accommodations?

If you need specific accommodations for the exam (for example extra time, breaks, or alternative formats), please email support@freecodecamp.org. We’ll review your request and see whether we can find a reasonable solution.

### Anything else?

Good luck working through freeCodeCamp’s languages coursework and preparing for the exam.

Happy learning!
