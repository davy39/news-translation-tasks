In this post we're going to take a look at how 2019 was for me (mostly professionally) and we're also going to set some goals for 2020! ?

I really love numbers, so I'm also going to show you how 2019 was in numbers. I'm also going to share some of the earnings that I made blogging, creating content, and freelancing.

Hopefully this will inspire you to start working on the things that you love (as I am doing now ?).

**Note:** the first part of the article is my 2019 story. So if you are only interested in the numbers and earnings part, jump down to the end of the article. ?

## 2019 In Review

### General Overview - The story

I started blogging again in **February 2019** after taking a break for 1.5 years. At the same time I was working as a Remote ReactJS developer for a company and spent my evenings and mornings writing articles. <br/>
I always liked the idea of sharing the things that I'm building so I decided to start blogging again, determined to make it work this time. ?

I also started being active on Twitter. I had around **300 followers** back in February 2019. <br/>
I quickly found out that the Twitter community is amazing, so it was a joy to share the little things that I was doing with the community - and the feedback was great!

Soon after that (somewhere around April or May) I noticed that people really enjoyed the things that I was doing (and saying ?). So I decided that, starting with January 2020, I was going to go full-time as a blogger. 

But...considering that I'm not the most patient guy in the world ?, in June I told my wife that I wanted to quit my job sooner. Like 6 months sooner. ?

At first she wasn't 100% on-board (I can't blame her as I was the only one providing for the family - she was still in school). But after doing some calculations we saw that I could give it a try because we had enough money saved to live off for the next 6 months. So she agreed (and I can't thank her enough, not only for accepting, but for supporting me throughout this journey ?).

### Become a full-time blogger + the "semi-depression"

So I did it. **5th July** was my last day as an employee.

My journey as a full-time blogger & content creator began! ?

**Note** that I also had some deals with publications which involved me writing tech articles for them - so at least I had the prospect of making a little bit of money. ?

I ended up only writing one or two paid articles (shame, shame!) and I soon got into a "semi-depression" (at least that's what I call it). <br/>
It mostly came from the fact that after 1-2 months of being a full-time blogger, I didn't achieved my expectations of writing X articles, making Y amount of money, etc... all the things that I'd been planning.

By this time I was making around **$150 a month** from Ads and Patreon - which obviously wasn't the amount I was expecting. And it was all my fault.

I had the opportunity to write paid articles, but for some reason I couldn't do it. I believe it was because of the pressure I put on myself for writing PERFECT articles because they were paid.

We took a 2 week break and visited the Black Sea. It did wonders for my mental health. I stopped putting so much pressure on myself and I started enjoying the process.

After we came home I took on the [$200 in 4 days Challenge](http://florin-pop.com/blog/2019/09/the-$200-challenge/) and I proved to myself that I was able to make money if I had to. This boosted my morale and my productivity increased!

Soon after that I started the [#100Days100Projects Challenge](http://florin-pop.com/blog/2019/09/100-days-100-projects) - creating one project every day for 100 days in a row.

This challenged ended up getting me one of the biggest deals ever which covered us in terms of the income for the rest of 2019.

### Started a YouTube channel

Fast-forward to November. After struggling a lot and thinking that my accent was bad (more or less in my mind), I decided to start a [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCeU-1X402kT-JlLdAitxSMA).

It exploded quickly thanks to my wonderful followers on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/florinpop1705), reaching 1,000 subscribers in less than a month! ?

### Finally made some cash ?

I've read many books and watched probably thousands of hours of YouTube videos and courses on how to monetize your passions (blog, YouTube channel, etc). So I finally ended up actually doing something in that regard. ?

I did 3 things to earn some extra money:

- Added ads on my blog
- Created a [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/florinpop17) page to be able to accept donations
- Became an affiliate and started promoting web development courses

_Below you can see how much I made._
