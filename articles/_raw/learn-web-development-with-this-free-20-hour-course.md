Are you a complete beginner interested in learning web development? Look no further!

We just published a comprehensive course about web development with HTML and CSS on the freeCodeCamp.org YouTube channel. This course is thoughtfully designed and taught by Aakash N S, the CEO and co-founder of Jovian, a platform for data science and machine learning. 

The course begins with the basics of HTML and CSS, delving into advanced concepts as we progress. You'll learn how to use Git, GitHub, and cloud deployment with Vercel. We'll also cover mobile-first responsive design, the Bootstrap CSS framework, and the Express web application framework.

Practical coding assignments are an integral part of the course. You'll be tasked with building a web page from a mockup, creating a responsive mobile-first website, and crafting a scientific calculator.
