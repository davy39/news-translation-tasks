Everyone should learn three skills that can help them make money in their life. This means that you won't have to rely on one skill to make money, and it gives you a chance to make a side income, too.

The value you can add at your job or to your side hustle is proportional to the skills you've acquired. The more tools, technologies, and tricks you learn, the better you'll be able to present your marketable skills. Which means you can make more money.

Acquiring additional skills – those related to coding and software development – is one of the most important things you will do.

In this article, I'll discuss some high-paying skills you can learn as a developer to broaden your skillset and make yourself more valuable.

## Video Editing

Video production is becoming increasingly crucial in marketing, content generation, and other facets of business.

It's one of the first activities that causes a company to hire a freelancer or consultancy, because it's usually a time-consuming task that requires particular knowledge and talent.

To get started, you should learn how to use a good video editing software. If you really want to dive deep into this, I recommend that you learn **Final Cut Pro** (Mac Only) or **Adobe Premiere Pro** (Windows & Mac).

Make a **Fiverr** account after learning how to use the video editing software. You can edit videos for online classes, make video advertising projects, or do any other type of video production to practice your new skills.

## Marketing

It's not enough to have good products or services – you also need good marketing to grow. Your potential clients will be unaware that you exist if you do not sell yourself and your product.

> How will someone know that your product exists?

Marketing includes email marketing, SEO marketing, content marketing, and social media marketing. These are really high-value skills, and you can charge a premium for doing this type of work as a freelancer.

You can start learning the basics of marketing by watching videos on YouTube and Skillshare. But nothing beats real-world experience as a teacher. Consider creating an internet side business to put your marketing knowledge into practise.

Better marketing = more sales = more profit. 😊

## Graphic Design

Graphic design, like video creation, is such a specialised ability that it is in high demand. Whether it's logo design, graphic marketing assets, or even PowerPoint presentations, there are lots of ways to add to your skillset.

When you can create stunning designs, you are usually well compensated. And brands want that. Engagement is the key to get more sales.

To get started as a freelancer, you can make an account on [**Fiverr**](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/p/8abab1e3-6ec0-425b-80fb-3229d2b609df/fiverr.com) or [**Upwork**](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/p/8abab1e3-6ec0-425b-80fb-3229d2b609df/upwork.com)***.*** You should also try to get some simple projects to get started. Having some projects to show on your profile really increases your chance of getting clients.

## Content Creation

In the creator economy, there's a lot of money to be made. And, no, you don't need a large number of followers to generate money on the internet. And the competition of getting started is also low in this niche.

Writing online is a full-time job for many, and believe me or not it's not that hard. What matters is that you're getting started by honing your content-creation abilities. You've become a part of the creator economy.

To start a blog, you can either start writing on [Medium](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/p/8abab1e3-6ec0-425b-80fb-3229d2b609df/medium.com) or [Hashnode](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/p/8abab1e3-6ec0-425b-80fb-3229d2b609df/hashnode.com). If you like to invest some money, then you could buy a domain to make a personal brand on your name. Then you can write about what you like or what you are learning.

For example, are you learning HTML? Then write about it.

You can also start a YouTube channel if you're not a great writer but can keep people interested in your stories. The more you play to your strengths, the more views and fans you'll get. You'll get more money if you get more views and follows.

## Podcasting

Do you listen to podcast? They've become very popular over the last decade or so. Listening to something is a great way to learn and stay updated with your community.

Have you ever thought of starting a podcast? It's pretty easy to get started. You could ask your team mates to talk about something for 10 - 20 minutes and put it online. There is always someone on the internet, who is ready to listen and get value from your thoughts.

### How to set up a Podcast:

1. Make an account on [Anchor](https://anchor.fm/).
    
2. Create a logo, and add a few pictures of yourself.
    
3. You will need to invest some money in buying a good microphone.
    
4. Yay! Now you can make your own podcast to share it with the world.
    

You can monitize your podcast by selling ads and doing brand sponsorships. You could also start a small group (like a premium membership) which you can charge for early access to your podcast. Mentorship is also an option.
