We believe that everyone deserves to have free programming education in their own native language. So we are expanding International Translation Day (September 30th) into a full month-long effort.

Over the past few years, hundreds of volunteer contributors have worked to translate freeCodeCamp into major world languages. In February, [Quincy announced](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/world-language-translation-effort/) that freeCodeCamp had successfully launched both Spanish and Chinese editions. And Portuguese and Italian soon followed.

During World Translation Month, we will celebrate what we have achieved collectively – and what we will accomplish for everybody around the world_._ Watch this one-minute announcement video:

_If you are interested in participating in translating freeCodeCamp into any world language, you can [visit our contributors channel and learn more](https://chat.freecodecamp.org/channel/contributors)._

## Latest Translation Accomplishments

Today, we have successfully launched the Italian and Brazilian Portuguese curriculum. We are eager to see what is to come for these active communities.

And the Ukrainian community has really taken off in their translation efforts. They have eight certifications fully translated and two close to 100%, almost all completed within a month. It is remarkable to witness the dedication and perseverance every language community has shown.

We have multiple other communities and individuals who are translating the curriculum to their native languages. You can take a look at the current statuses of all the active translations and their progress here.

Currently, volunteers around the world are in the process of translating freeCodeCamp's curriculum into 28 world languages.

And many of these world languages are showing significant progress, especially the French, Romanian, Japanese, and German-speaking communities. Keep up the great work!

## What is the Goal of the World Translation Month Event?

freeCodeCamp's goal is to give every individual the tools to translate the curriculum into their native language. Also, we will dedicate all our efforts and time to this event to reach significant progress for every world language. 

We have witnessed what a handful of contributors can do together with a singular purpose. And we hope that World Translation Month will become a yearly event when all world languages can celebrate having access to free programming education translated by their community for their community.

## Our Reward System 🥇

freeCodeCamp wants to make this a memorable event for every contributor who participates.

During the WTM event, we will give all participants a World Translation Month Badge. Also, at the end of the event, we will present special badges to the Top Translators and Top Proofreaders who have made the most contributions. 

You can display these badges on your freeCodeCamp curriculum and forum profiles if you want to do so.

## The freeCodeCamp Localization Roadmap

The freeCodeCamp curriculum is already available in Chinese and Spanish. And beyond this, these communities have many other resources at their disposal, thanks to the efforts of hundreds of contributors.

For example, the Chinese-speaking community has translated nearly all the certifications into Chinese. They also have close to 600 articles translated, there are 10 of freeCodeCamp's video tutorials with subtitles on [Bilibili](https://space.bilibili.com/335505768/video), and they've organized hundreds of meetups, hackathons, conferences, live coding events, and coding workshops in universities and high schools.

_freeCodeCamp bilibili 频道_

The Spanish-speaking community has the first two certifications available in Spanish, and they've translated around 250 articles. Community members have also written about 20 original articles, created 3 original full-length video tutorials, and [Estefania](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/p/fc63f178-c627-414a-8ae6-877eb3458261/@EstefaniaCassN) has created 24 short videos for the Spanish YouTube channel. 

The response from the Spanish-speaking community has been remarkable on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/c/freeCodeCampEspa%C3%B1ol/videos) and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/freecodecampES). Thanks to the fantastic job Estefania has been doing by engaging with the community with posts and short videos on YouTube, the channel now has over 12,000 followers. And freeCodeCamp's Twitter account en Español has reached 7,300 followers while continuing to grow.

## The Translation Blueprint

As Quincy mentioned in the [World Language Translation Effort](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/world-language-translation-effort/) article, freeCodeCamp's "_...long-term goal is for each of these language communities to come into its own._" 

And we'll take the same steps as we took with the thriving Spanish-speaking and Chinese-speaking communities with other language communities around the world. 

The plan is to launch a localized publication, YouTube Channel, sub-forum, and Twitter account for these language communities, each with their own contributors and staff.

## Thank You to All the Translators, Contributors, and Proofreaders!

I want to finish up by thanking the proofreaders and translators who have dedicated hours upon hours to translating and proofreading.
