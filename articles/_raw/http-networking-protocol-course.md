HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) is the foundation of data communication on the World Wide Web. It is used to transfer data from the client (web browser) to the server (web host) and vice versa. Understanding the basics of HTTP networking is crucial for anyone who wants to pursue a career in web development.

We just published a full course on the freeCodeCamp.org YouTube channel that will help you master the HTTP networking protocol by completing over 80 coding exercises and quizzes in JavaScript. The course is designed to help students understand the various concepts of HTTP networking through hands-on learning.

Lane Wagner created this course. He is a senior back end engineer and is the creator of boot.dev where he has published many interactive courses.

Starting from the basics, students watching this course will learn about:

* why HTTP is important, 
* how DNS (Domain Name System) works,
* the difference between URIs (Uniform Resource Identifiers) and URLs (Uniform Resource Locators),
* how HTTP headers work,
* how to write and use JSON (JavaScript Object Notation),
* the difference between various HTTP methods,
* how URL paths are used in HTTP communication, and
* implementing security using HTTPS.

To help students put their knowledge into practice, the course includes a project where they will build a real web crawler using Node.js. The project will cover the following topics: setting up a development environment, creating a "Hello World" program, normalizing URLs, extracting URLs from HTML, using the Fetch API, recursively crawling the web, and printing an SEO report.

By the end of this video course, students will have a solid understanding of HTTP networking and will be able to put their skills into practice by building a real web crawler.

In conclusion, if you're looking to deepen your knowledge of HTTP networking and build practical skills, this video course is an excellent choice. With over 80 coding exercises and quizzes, students will get a hands-on learning experience that will help them understand the various concepts of HTTP networking. Sign up now and start your journey to mastering HTTP networking.
