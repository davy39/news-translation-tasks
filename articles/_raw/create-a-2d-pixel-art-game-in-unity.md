Learn how to build a complete 2D Pixel Art Tower Defense game in Unity from scratch!

We just posted a step-by-step tutorial on the freeCodeCamp.org YouTube channel that will guide you from a blank project to a fully playable game with a main menu, multiple tower types, enemy waves, and three unique levels. Frank from Frank’s Laboratory developed this course.

You’ll learn how to create a modular, data-driven system using Scriptable Objects to manage towers, enemies, and waves, plus how to design forest, lava, and jungle levels with Unity Tilemaps.

In this tutorial, you’ll learn:

* How to set up 2D Tilemap levels in Unity
    
* Animate pixel-art characters
    
* Build towers and spawn enemy waves
    
* Design diverse game worlds with Tilemaps
    
* Export builds for Windows, Android, and Web
    
* Publish and share your game online
