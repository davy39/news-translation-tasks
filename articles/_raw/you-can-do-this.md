Learning to code is hard. Anyone who tells you otherwise is probably trying to sell you something.

Every one of our coding journeys is a bit different. But all of us face challenges - and the emotional ups and downs that come with them.

The good news is there are millions of other people out there who are learning to code, too. And we can all help one another stay motivated throughout the process.

You Can Do This! is a new place on the freeCodeCamp forum where you can share your victories, your setbacks, and little shots of motivation.

We're all in this together. We can help each other keep moving forward together. [Get started here](https://www.freecodecamp.org/forum/c/motivation).

And remember: You can do this!
