Statistics is a vital field for software developers and data scientists. 

In this course, you'll learn the essential concepts of statistics - all taught to you by Monika Wahi, a lecturer at Labouré College.

This course will introduce you to the various methods scientists use to collect, organize, summarize, interpret, and reach conclusions about data. It places an emphasis on demonstrating that statistics is more than mathematical calculations. 

By using examples gathered from real life, you'll learn how to use statistical methods as analytical tools to develop generalizations and draw better conclusions.

This course covers:

* What statistics is
* Sampling
* Experimental design
* Randomization
* Frequency histogram and distribution
* Time series, bar and pie graphs
* Frequency table and stem-and-leaf
* Measures of central tendency
* Measure of variation
* Percentile and box-and-whisker plots
* Scatter diagrams and linear correlation
* Normal distribution and empirical rule
* Z-score and probabilities
* Sampling distributions and the central limit theorem

You can watch the full video course on the [freeCodeCamp.org YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxpc-HPKN28) (8 hour watch).
