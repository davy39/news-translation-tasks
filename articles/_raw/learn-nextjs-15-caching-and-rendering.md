Learn Next.js 15 Caching & Rendering using the App Router.

We just posted a course on the freeCodeCamp.org YouTube channel for people who want a clear, engineering-level understanding of how Next.js optimizes performance through smart rendering strategies and layered caching. This course was developed by Sumit Saha.

You'll gain a deep understanding of Next.js rendering strategies, including Static Site Generation (SSG), Server-Side Rendering (SSR), Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR), and Client-Side Rendering (CSR). You'll also explore the intricacies of React Client and Server Components, along with the React Server Component (RSC) payload. Furthermore, the course will cover various Next.js caching strategies, such as Request Memoization, Data Cache, Full Route Cache, and Router Cache, all reinforced with practical examples to facilitate hands-on learning.

Here are the sections in this course:

* Intro
    
* What is Caching
    
* Rendering Strategies - SSG SSR ISR CSR
    
* React Client & Server Components - Hydration
    
* RSC Payload
    
* How Rendering works in Next.js
    
* Why Caching Strategies
    
* Discover Caching Strategies
