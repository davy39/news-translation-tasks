On this week's episode of the podcast, I interview Ryan Furrer. He's a Front End Engineer working on tools that help companies monitor their buildings for energy usage, water leaks, and other environmental factors.

Ryan dropped out of college and worked as a musician and violin instructor. He spent 5 years teaching himself how to program before getting freelance gigs, and ultimately landing developer jobs.

We talk about:

* Life as a broke musician
    
* Teaching yourself to code while working full-time
    
* How Ryan had to move back in with his parents after a divorce
    
* His 5-year journey to his first developer job
