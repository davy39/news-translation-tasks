Did you check Instagram today or watch YouTube? Well, you used a Python-based application! Python is one of the most popular programming languages.

We just published a new Python course on the freeCodeCamp.org YouTube channel.

We have quite a few Python courses on the freeCodeCamp.org YouTube channel so you may be wondering why we need another one. This course uses an interesting approach to teaching Python. You will learn Python by thinking in types. The course focuses on basic programming concepts rather than just teaching the language syntax. It's always helpful to learn from many different perspectives and this course may be just what you need to understand Python.

Anil Kulkarni from Octallium developed this course. Anil is known for creating easy-to-understand videos, tutorials, and articles

Python is the perfect language to learn for beginners. With Python you can do almost anything: create your own web applications, create games, desktop applications, data science projects, AI, and more! 

While Python is one of the easiest language to learn, it can often take a lot of time and practice to really master it. People often confuse learning language syntax with learning programming. In this course, this difference is made very clear. You will be guided through the basic principles needed to learn Python in an efficient manner.
