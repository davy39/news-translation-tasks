In the ever-evolving landscape of business, understanding the intricacies of finance and economics is essential for success. Topics such as the principles of money and deciphering the impact of macroeconomic changes serve as the bedrock of strategic decision-making.

We just posted a full course on the freeCodeCamp.org YouTube channel that will teach you the fundamentals of finance & economics for businesses. The course is designed to empower you with the knowledge and skills needed to navigate this complex terrain.

Sriram Chundi created this course. He previously taught the course to students in-person, and now brings it to the world through the freeCodeCamp.org YouTube channel. The course offers an in-depth exploration of the fundamentals of business strategy, finance, and economics.

One of the key takeaways from this course is the recognition of the symbiotic relationship between finance, economics, and business strategy. Often seen as distinct disciplines, they are intricately linked in the real-world functioning of companies. As you progress through the course, you'll discover how macroeconomic shifts can exert a profound influence on businesses, ranging from multinational corporations to local startups. Simultaneously, you'll gain insights into the significance of minute details within financial documents, which can serve as early indicators of a company's financial health or vulnerability.
