Python, SQL, and other open source tools have made it easier than ever to get into data analysis.

You can learn how to use Python for data analysis in this new 4-hour course on the freeCodeCamp YouTube channel.

This free course was created by Santiago Basulto from RMOTR.

Santiago teaches the capabilities of Python and the entire PyData stack to perform data analysis.

The course reviews some basic Python concepts, then teaches you:

* how to read data from multiple sources (CSVs, SQL, Excel)
* how to clean and transform data using NumPy and Pandas
* how to visualize data using Matplotlib and Seaborn
* how to process data to create reports.

Besides learning the basics of data analysis, you will also learn how to use Jupyter Notebook.

We provide Notebook files and code to go along with each section so you can run the code yourself.

We also include lots of exercises so you can practice what you learn.

Watch the full course below, or on [the freeCodeCamp.org YouTube channel](https://youtu.be/r-uOLxNrNk8) (4-hour watch).
