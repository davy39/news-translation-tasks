Natural language processing (NLP) is a branch of artificial intelligence that helps computers understand, interpret, and manipulate human language.

This video will provide you with a comprehensive and detailed knowledge of Natural Language Processing. You will also learn about the different steps involved in processing the human language like Tokenization, Stemming, Lemmatization and more.

Python, NLTK, & Jupyter Notebook are used to demonstrate the concepts.

You can watch the video on the [the freeCodeCamp.org YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2vAabgKiuM) (38 minute watch).‌
