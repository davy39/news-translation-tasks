Data is everywhere, but raw numbers on a screen rarely tell a compelling story. To uncover insights and communicate them effectively, you need to make that data visible and interactive.

We just posted a new course on the [freeCodeCamp.org](http://freeCodeCamp.org) YouTube channel.

In this course, instructor Gregory Kirchoff will guide you through building beautiful, interactive data visualizations from scratch using the power of Svelte and the flexibility of D3.

Here are some of the key concepts covered:

* How to build a simple, bare-bones scatter plot to understand the core concepts.
    
* Setting up and managing an SVG canvas for your visualizations.
    
* Handling data scales to map your data values to pixel coordinates on the screen.
    
* Adding interactivity to allow users to dynamically update the chart.
    
* Bringing your charts to life with smooth animations and transitions.
    
* Making your visualizations responsive so they look great on any device.
    
* Fetching and parsing real-world data from external sources.
    

To keep things engaging, you’ll work with fun and unique datasets, starting with the results from a pig racing league and later using the Pokémon API to compare stats like weight, height, and speed.
