Today Quincy Larson interviews Kunal Kushwaha. He's a software engineer and prolific computer science teacher on YouTube. He failed the JEE, the Indian Engineering Entrance Exam, TWICE. But he persevered. He did 4 years of university but attended ZERO lectures. Instead he built his own learning path by contributed to open source projects and using free learning resources including freeCodeCamp.

He moved from Delhi to London on a UK Global Talent Visa. He works at Cast AI and is the founder of the WeMakeDevs community.

We'll talk about:

* How he teaches himself new skills, then teaches those skills through his YouTube channel
    
* His day-to-day working remotely at startups
    
* His role in building out cloud regions as a field CTO at Civo, a cloud native service provider
    
* The Indian higher education system

1. freeCodeCamp's New Responsive Web Design Certification is now live. You can now take the final exam and earn this FREE verified cert, then add it to your LinkedIn, CV, or personal website. Announcement article: [https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/freecodecamps-new-responsive-web-design-certification-is-now-live/](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/freecodecamps-new-responsive-web-design-certification-is-now-live/)
    
2. Before modern Large Language Models, scientists and developers worked with more fundamental Natural Language Processing tools. freeCodeCamp just published a handbook that will help you understand the tools that power chatbots, machine translation, text summarization, and more. You'll learn how computers analyze syntax, model semantics, and interpret context. Then you'll use popular Python libraries to apply those concepts to real projects. (full length handbook): [https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-use-nlp-techniques-and-tools-in-your-projects-full-handbook/](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-use-nlp-techniques-and-tools-in-your-projects-full-handbook/)
    
3. freeCodeCamp also published a handbook that will give you a nuanced understanding of one of the trickier aspects of JavaScript development: Closures. First you'll learn about functions, parameters, and lexical scope. Then you'll learn how a Closure "closes over" a variable to keep it safe, while still granting you access to its values through function calls. If this sounds complicated, it is. But fear not – this handbook will give you tons of code examples of Closure mechanics, and teach you when to use them.

4. Flexbox is a powerful CSS feature that lets you build user interfaces that fit any screen size. If you’ve ever struggled to center something with CSS or tried to make columns line up nicely, well, Flexbox simplifies this dramatically. freeCodeCamp just published a Flexbox for beginners course where you'll learn both the concepts and the code syntax while building a responsive website navigation bar. (2 hour YouTube course): [https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/learn-css-flexbox-for-beginners-free-2-hour-course](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/learn-css-flexbox-for-beginners-free-2-hour-course)
    
5. When you're working with Large Language Models, every additional token adds cost and latency. Microsoft just open-sourced a tool called LLMLingua that will compress your prompts and other context window data. freeCodeCamp published this tutorial to help you understand how this works and how you can add it to your Python projects. (10 minute read): [https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-compress-your-prompts-and-reduce-llm-costs/](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-compress-your-prompts-and-reduce-llm-costs/)
    
6. It is with great pride that I announce our Top Open Source Contributors of 2025. It's been a super productive year for the global freeCodeCamp community. As we start our 12th year as a community, we’re firing on all cylinders, pushing forward more steadily than ever toward a future of open source education: [https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/freecodecamp-top-open-source-contributors-2025](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/freecodecamp-top-open-source-contributors-2025)
    
7. Today's song of the week is 1983 anthem Rock of Ages by British rock band Def Leppard. This is a silly, feel-good song with excellent vocal harmonies and massive-sounding drums. As a kid, when I saw the music video with the singer wielding a giant sword in a cave it blew my mind.
