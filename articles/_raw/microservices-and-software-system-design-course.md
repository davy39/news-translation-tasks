A microservices architecture is a type of application architecture where the application is developed as a collection of services.  

We just published a course on the freeCodeCamp.org YouTube channel that will teach you about microservice architecture and distributed systems using a hands-on approach. 

Georgio from Kantan Coding teaches this course. He does a great job teaching how to combine a bunch of different technologies into a single application.

In this course, you will design an app using using Python, Kubernetes, RabbitMQ, MongoDB, & mySQL.

Here are the sections in this course:

* Overview 
* Installation & Setup?
* Auth Service Code
* Auth Flow Overview & JWTs
* Auth Service Deployment
* Auth Dockerfile
* Kubernetes
* Gateway Service Code
* MongoDB & GridFs
* Architecture Overview (RabbitMQ)
* Synchronous Interservice Communication
* Asynchronous Interservice Communication
* Strong Consistency
* Eventual Consistency
* RabbitMQ
* Gateway Service Deployment
* Kubernetes Ingress
* Kubernetes StatefulSet
* RabbitMQ Deployment
* Converter Service Code
* Converter Service Deployment
* Checkpoint
* Update Gateway Service
* Notification Service Code
* Notification Service Deployment
* Sanity Check
