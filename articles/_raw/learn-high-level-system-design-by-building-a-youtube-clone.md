High-Level System Design involves creating a blueprint for complex systems, focusing on architecture, component interactions, and scalability. It addresses how different parts of a system communicate, manage data, and handle user requests efficiently.

We just published a course on the freeCodeCamp.org YouTube channel about high-level system design. This course offers a unique hands-on approach to understanding high-level system design (HLD) concepts by building a fully functional YouTube-like platform. Keerti Purswani developed this courese.

## What is High-Level System Design?

High-Level System Design involves creating a blueprint for complex systems, focusing on architecture, component interactions, and scalability. It addresses how different parts of a system communicate, manage data, and handle user requests efficiently.

## Course Overview

In this course, you will start with a basic system flow and gradually incorporate three key services: **upload, watch, and transcoder**. Each service is important to building a scalable and robust video platform. Here’s a detailed look at what you will learn:

1. **Upload Service**: Learn how to handle video uploads effectively, including chunking and managing large file transfers.
    
2. **Transcoder Service**: Dive into transcoding with FFmpeg, a powerful tool for converting video formats and optimizing videos for different devices.
    
3. **Watch Service**: Implement Adaptive Bitrate Streaming using HLS (HTTP Live Streaming) to ensure smooth playback across various network conditions and devices.
    

#### Technologies Covered

This course leverages a range of modern technologies to build the YouTube clone:

* **Front-end**: JavaScript and React for creating dynamic user interfaces.
    
* **Back-end**: Node.js and Express for building scalable server-side applications.
    
* **Database**: Prisma as an ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) tool to interact with databases.
    
* **Frameworks**: Next.js for server-side rendering and improved performance.
    
* **Other Tools**: Docker for containerization and Redis for caching to enhance performance and scalability.
    

By the end of this course, you will have a deep understanding of high-level system design principles and practical experience in building a complex application. Watch the full course on [the freeCodeCamp.org YouTube channel](https://youtu.be/FiXOaYnW64w) (2-hour watch).
