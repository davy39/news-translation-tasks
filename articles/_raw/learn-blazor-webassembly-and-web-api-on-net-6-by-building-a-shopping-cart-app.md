Blazor WebAssembly is a single-page app framework for building interactive client-side web apps with .NET. It uses open web standards without plugins or recompiling code into other languages.

We just published a full course on the freeCodeCamp.org YouTube channel that will teach you how to use Blazor WebAssembly and Web API on .NET 6.

In this course you will learn step-by-step how to build a shopping cart application.  
This course also provides a guide on how to integrate a payment gateway into your Blazor WebAssembly component, so that a user is able to pay for products through your application using a debit or credit card or PayPal account.

Gavin Lon teaches this course. Gavin is a senior software engineer with over 20 years of experience. 

Here are all the sections covered in this course:

* Create the Database using EF Core Code First Database Migrations
* Retrieve Product Data from Database (Web API component)
* Create Classes for Data Transfer Objects (DTOs)
* Create ProductRepository Class (Repository Design Pattern)
* Create ProductController Class
* Create DtoConversion Class (DTO Conversion Extension methods)
* Display Product Data to User (Blazor WebAssembly Component)
* Display Data for Specific Product to User (Web API and Blazor)
