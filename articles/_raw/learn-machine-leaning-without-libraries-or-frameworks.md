Are you ready to unravel the mysteries of machine learning algorithms and elevate your software development skills? Look no further! 

We just published a machine learning course on the freeCodeCamp.org YouTube channel.

This "No Black Box" Machine Learning Course in JavaScript offers a unique, hands-on approach to understanding machine learning systems by coding from scratch, without relying on libraries. By delving into the inner workings of these algorithms, you'll gain valuable insights and experience that will help you become a more proficient developer.

Radu Mariescu-Istodor created this course. He is a passionate computer scientist and educator with a Ph.D. in Computer Science. He lives in Finland and works as a Lecturer in Computer Science at Karelia University of Applied Sciences. Radu is also a skilled content creator who shares coding tutorials and other related content on YouTube, empowering developers around the world to expand their knowledge and expertise.

Throughout this comprehensive course, you'll build various applications, such as a drawing app, data visualizer, and custom chart. You'll explore feature extraction, data scaling, and dive into essential machine learning techniques like Nearest Neighbor Classifier and K Nearest Neighbors Classifier. The course also includes practical homework assignments to reinforce your learning and model evaluation techniques for measuring the performance of your algorithms.

Under Radu's expert guidance, you'll progress through sections dedicated to working with data, creating data visualizations, and implementing classifiers. Toward the end of the course, you'll even get a chance to work with Python and SkLearn for a well-rounded machine learning experience.

By taking this course, you'll not only gain a deep understanding of the inner workings of machine learning algorithms but also significantly improve your software development skills. Radu's engaging teaching style and vast expertise in the field make this course a must for anyone looking to unlock the secrets of machine learning in JavaScript.

Don't miss this opportunity to learn from a seasoned professional and enhance your development skills. Watch the full course on [the freeCodeCamp.org YouTube channel](https://youtu.be/vDDjtwQDw2k) (4-hour watch).
