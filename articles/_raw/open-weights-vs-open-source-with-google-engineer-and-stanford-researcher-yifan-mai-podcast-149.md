On this week's episode of the podcast, I interview Yifan Mai, a Senior Software Engineer on Google's TensorFlow team who left the private sector to go do AI research at Stanford.

He's the lead maintainer of the open source HELM project, where he benchmarks the performance of Large Language Models.

We talk about:

* Open Source VS Open Weights in LLMs
    
* The Ragged Frontier of LLM use cases
    
* AI impact on jobs and our predictions
    
* What to learn so you can stay above the waterline
    

Can you guess what song I'm playing in the intro? I put the entire cover song at the end of the podcast if you want to listen to it, and you can watch me play all the instruments on the YouTube version of this episode.
