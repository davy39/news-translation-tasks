Node.js and Express.js are popular technologies used for JavaScript backend web development.

We just released a 10-hour course on the freeCodeCamp.org YouTube channel that will show you how to create four projects using Node and Express.

John Smilga developed this course. John is one of the more prolific contributors to the freeCodeCamp YouTube channel. He has created a bunch of well-loved courses.
