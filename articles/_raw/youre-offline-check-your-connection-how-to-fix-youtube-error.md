## What Causes the "You're offline. Check your Connection." YouTube Error?
Most errors you encounter online will contain error messages that tell you what went wrong and how to fix them. 

In the case of this error, it is related to your internet connection. That's why a part of the error message says "You're offline". Therefore, the causes include:

* A poor or unstable network.
* A faulty Wi-Fi adapter connection.
* An outdated YouTube app or browser.
* Corrupted cache data.

The other part of the error message says "Check your connection". So make sure your internet connection is stable. 

But your internet connection may not be the only reason for this error. Read on to see other solutions you can use to fix the error.

## How to Fix the "You're offline. Check your Connection." YouTube Error
Since the error is network-related, some **quick fixes** you can try include:

* Make sure your internet connection is good.
* Refresh the YouTube website or tap retry in the YouTube mobile app.
* Refresh the YouTube mobile app.
* Restart the YouTube mobile app.
* Clear your browser cache.
* Make sure your PC or mobile phone is not in airplane mode.

If all of the quick fixes above fail to work, then keep reading to see other solutions you can use to fix the error on both PC and mobile. 

## How to Fix the "You're offline. Check your Connection." YouTube Error on a Computer 

### Disable your Ad Blocker
Ad blockers are software programs that prevent adverts from appearing on websites. They work by blocking the code that displays ads, such as images or videos, before they can be loaded in the browser. 

While ad blockers can improve the user experience by removing annoying and intrusive ads, they can also interfere with some website functionalities, including YouTube.

So, disabling the ad blocker(s) on your computer might be enough to get YouTube working again.

### Disable your Virtual Private Network (VPN)
A Virtual Private Network (VPN) can interfere with websites like YouTube and cause them not to work properly due to restrictions in the virtual server's location, configuration issues, network congestion, and so on.

So, just like disabling ad blockers, disabling your VPN can be a solution to the error.

### Flush your Computer's DNS in the Command Line
Sometimes, clearing your browser's cache might not be enough to get rid of corrupted cache data because the cache might be on your computer itself. 

In that case, you need to clear your computer's cache too. And flushing your DNS gets rid of it for you.

To flush your PC's DNS, open CMD and run the following commands one by one:

* `ipconfig /flushdns`
* `ipconfig /release`
* `ipconfig /renew`

## How to Fix the "You're offline. Check your Connection." YouTube Error on a Mobile Phone

### Update the YouTube Mobile App 
If you use an Android device, head over to the Play Store and update the YouTube app if updates are available. And if you use an iPhone, you can download the latest version of the YouTube app on the iOS App Store.

But sometimes, the error occurs even if your mobile app is up to date. In that case, the next solution might fix it for you.

### Force Stop and Clear your Mobile App's Cache Data
On an Android phone, long-tap the YouTube app and select "App info":

Tap on "Clear cache":
