On this week's episode of the podcast, I interview Francesco Ciulla. He's a software engineer who has worked with the European Space Agency on code that powers the Copernicus satellite program.

More Francesco has published courses on learning Docker and the Rust programming language.

We talk about:

* How Francesco worked as a volleyball coach until we was 32, before getting serious about coding
    
* Francesco's work on coding satellites
    
* How he's given dozens of talks about emerging tools at major tech conferences
    
* How he creates tech tutorials even though he's a proud introvert who has to put himself out there
    

You can watch the interview on the freeCodeCamp YouTube channel.

Or you can listen to the podcast in Apple Podcasts, Spotify, or your favorite podcast app. Be sure to follow the freeCodeCamp Podcast there so you'll get new episodes each Friday.
