freeCodeCamp just posted a Harvard University course that will give you a solid introduction to cybersecurity.

It's taught by one of the world's most-loved computer science teachers, Dr. David J. Malan.

In this course, you’ll learn how to secure your accounts, data, systems, and software against today’s threats. You’ll also learn how to recognize and evaluate tomorrow’s, both at home and at work. Then you’ll learn how to preserve your own privacy as well.

This course teaches you how to view cybersecurity not in absolute terms but in relative ones as well: as a function of risks and rewards (for an adversary) and costs and benefits (for you).

Dr. Malan presents both high-level and low-level examples of threats, providing students with all they need to know technically to understand both.

Here are the sections in this course:

* Introduction
    
* Securing Accounts
    
* Securing Data
    
* Securing Systems
    
* Securing Software
    
* Preserving Privacy
    

Watch the course on [the freeCodeCamp.org YouTube channel](https://youtu.be/9HOpanT0GRs) (8-hour watch).
