In 2015, the United Nations came together to adopt Agenda 2030 for Sustainable Development, a set of 17 [Sustainable Development Goals](https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/sdgs) (SDGs) covering topics such as health, inequality, climate change, and more. Since their adoption, the SDGs have served as a platform for organizing global, national, local, and individual action.

With the help of [SDG Academy](https://courses.sdgacademy.org/), a free online education platform from the UN’s [Sustainable Development Solutions Network](http://unsdsn.org/) (SDSN), **Class Central** has pulled together a giant list of courses that will teach you about the SDGs.

The [SDG Academy](https://courses.sdgacademy.org/) alone has produced 20 courses on cross-cutting issues related to the SDGs — such as human rights, resilience, and environmental security. This list also includes courses sourced from various other MOOC platforms, all organized by which goal they address.

Overall, SDG Academy helped me identify more than 80 courses on [sustainable development](https://www.class-central.com/subject/sustainability) from global universities including Harvard, Oxford, Stanford, and MIT.

Whether you’re interested in poverty reduction, human rights, food security, public health, education, or any other sustainable development topic, these courses will help you join efforts to achieve prosperity for both people and planet.
