Did you know that Visual Basic is currently a more popular programming language than JavaScript? That is according to [the TIOBE index](https://www.tiobe.com/tiobe-index/), which is one of the most respected indicators of the popularity of programming languages.

Visual Basic is an object-oriented programming language developed by Microsoft. It makes it fast and easy to create type-safe .NET apps. Some common uses for Visual Basic are creating Windows-based applications, utilities to perform specific tasks, and adding functionality to existing applications.

We just published a full visual basic course for beginners on the freeCodeCamp.org YouTube channel.

Kevin Drumm created this course. Kevin is the head of computer science at a school in the UK. He has also created hundreds of programming tutorials.

In this course you will learn about the basic constructs of high level programming languages, including sequence, selection and iteration. You will learn how to build an event-driven, form-based, user interface to capture input, and you will learn how to write code to validate and process the data collected. 

Here are the sections in this course:

* Hello Visual Studio
* Customise The Visual Studio IDE
* Output and Variables
* Variable Data Types
* Input with Windows Forms
* Debugging Code
* Arithmetic Operators
* Complex Arithmetic Expressions
* Selection with If Statements
* Logical and Relational Operators 1
* Logical and Relational Operators 2
* Select Case
* For Next
* Practice For Next Loops & If Blocks
* Do While
* Condition Controlled Loops
* Array Variables
* Practice Arrays & Loops
* Linear Search
* Two Dimensional Arrays
* 2D Arrays & Nested Loops
