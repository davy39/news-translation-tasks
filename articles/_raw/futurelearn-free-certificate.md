Ah, the good old days! Back when [Class Central](https://www.classcentral.com/) started covering [massive open online courses (MOOCs)](https://www.classcentral.com/help/moocs), almost all course [certificates were free.](https://www.classcentral.com/report/death-of-free-certificates/) Then, one by one, the major MOOC platforms began offering paid upgrades to verified certificates, then all but stopped giving out free certificates.

This isn’t to say that there isn’t still great content available for free. In fact, Class Central lists more than [1,150 Coursera courses that are still completely free](https://www.classcentral.com/report/coursera-free-online-courses/). We’ve also catalogued close to [400 courses you can take for free](https://www.classcentral.com/report/free-for-credit-moocs/), that are essentially the same courses that are offered for credit in online degree programs.

As it turns out, there are even a few courses in which you can still earn a free certificate. While trying to collect pricing data for FutureLearn courses, I discovered 17 courses on the FutureLearn platform that offer a free “digital upgrade”, which includes unlimited access to the course, quizzes, and a Certificate of Achievement on completion. These courses span a wide range of topics, from soil science to social media. They come from private companies like Accenture, public institutions like the British Council, and respected universities like King’s College London.
