Discrete mathematics plays a key role in machine learning and algorithms. You can use it to find the shortest path (graph theory), encrypt files, compress data, and to do many other things.

We just posted a discreet mathematics course on the freeCodeCamp.org YouTube channel. Karol Kurek teaches this course. He is a former math teacher and senior Python developer.

This field is constantly evolving along with the development of its key application: computer science. This course is an introduction to this group of mathematical sciences, and we will focus on the most important issues on which other branches of discrete mathematics are based: combinatorics, number theory, prime numbers, and several selected topics: pigeonhole principle, stars and bars principle, Stirling's number, and the Chinese remainder theorem.

At the end of the course, there are tips and encouragement for further exploration of this field.

Here are the sections in this course:

* Introduction to Discrete Mathematics
    
* Permutations: Definition and Examples
    
* Applications of Permutations
    
* Cycles and Multiset Permutations
    
* Counting Permutations: The Formulas
    
* Permutations in Python with itertools
    
* Custom Python Function for Counting Permutations
    
* Heap's Algorithm
    
* K-Permutations and K-Tuples
    
* The Rule of Product
    
* The Rule of Sum
    
* Exercises: Rule of Product & Sum

* Exercises: Inclusion-Exclusion Principle
    
* Mathematical Notations (Sigma & Pi)
    
* Equinumerosity & Countable Sets
    
* Proving Rational Numbers are Countable
    
* Prime Numbers & Sieve of Eratosthenes
    
* Prime Number Generation in Python
    
* Advanced Properties of Prime Numbers
    
* GCD & LCM (Greatest Common Divisor & Least Common Multiple)
    
* Co-prime Numbers
    
* Congruences (Modular Arithmetic)
    
* Binomial Coefficients & Pascal's Triangle
    
* Combinations
