Next.js makes developing React applications simpler. It provides a common structure that allows you to build frontend React applications, and transparently handles server-side rendering for you.

We just released a full course on the freeCodeCamp.org YouTube channel that will teach you the basics of Next.js. 

Kapehe developed the course. She is a devrel specialist at [Sanity.io](http://sanity.io/) and she is an excellent teacher.

In this course, you will learn how to be proficient with Next.js. Through building a full-stack recipe app with Next.js, Sanity.io, and Vercel, you'll learn how to set up dynamic routing, pre-render, pull content from external APIs, set up serverless functions, offer real-time content previews, and deploy your app on the web.

Here are the sections covered in this course:

* What is Next.js
* Tools: Node.js, VS Code, and the command line
* Setting up Next.js
* Setting the Sanity Studio CMS
* Connecting Next.js with your content lake
* Making a simple navigation bar in _app.js
* Making your first page template in index.js
* Setting up dynamic routes with [slug].js
* Diving into data fetching and pre-rendering with getStaticPaths & getStaticProps 
* Create a like button with API routes and serverless functions
* Adding live real-time preview with Sanity.io's content lake
* Set up automatic deployment with GitHub and Vercel
* Summary: What you have learned and next steps
