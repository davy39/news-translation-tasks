Django is one of the most popular ways to create full-stack websites with Python.

We just published an 18-hour Django course on the freeCodeCamp.org YouTube channel.

Charles Severance (a.k.a. Dr. Chuck) created this course, along with the popular Python for Everybody course. He is a Clinical Professor at the University of Michigan School of Information, where he teaches various technology-oriented courses including programming, database design, and Web development.

This course introduces Python programmers to building websites using the Django library. As part of the course you will learn HTML, CSS, SQL, Django, JavaScript, jQuery, and JSON Web Services.
