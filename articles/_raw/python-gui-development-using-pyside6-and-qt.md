Learn how to build cross platform desktop apps for Windows, Mac and Linux.

PySide6 is a Python binding for the Qt6 application framework. PySide6 allows you to use the Qt6 framework to create graphical user interfaces (GUIs) and other cross-platform applications in Python. It provides a convenient way to access the various components of the Qt6 framework, including widgets, signals, and slots. PySide6 is a free and open-source project maintained by the Qt Company.

We just published a full course on the freeCodeCamp.org YouTube channel that will teach you how to use PySide6 and Qt to develop applications.
