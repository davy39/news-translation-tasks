Robust authentication methods are important for a variety of web application. An increasingly popular and very secure type is Passkey Authentication.

We just posted a course on the freeCodeCamp.org YouTube channel that focuses on the implementation of passkey authentication using the Web Authentication API, also known as Webauthn. Dev Rhino created this course.

This comprehensive tutorial is designed for developers looking to enhance their skills in modern web security techniques. It guides viewers through the process of building a simple application that leverages Passkeys for authentication, a method that is rapidly gaining traction due to its enhanced security and user-friendly nature compared to traditional password-based systems.

The Web Authentication API (Webauthn) stands at the forefront of this tutorial. This cutting-edge technology enables servers to register and authenticate users using public key cryptography, a significant advancement over conventional password-based methods. Throughout the course, learners will gain hands-on experience with Webauthn, understanding its intricacies and applications in real-world scenarios.

To provide a practical and accessible learning experience, the tutorial utilizes Express.js, a popular web application framework for Node.js. This choice ensures that participants can focus on the core concepts of Webauthn without getting bogged down by complex setup procedures.

The tutorial also makes use of Docker, a powerful tool that simplifies the process of setting up and managing development environments.

Here are the sections of this course:

* Introduction
* Prerequisites
* Expected end result
* Getting started
* Configure Sequelize
* Set up Postgres
* Routes and controllers
* Frontend views
* Public key credentials
* Configure Passport.js
* Sessions
* Passkeys overview
* Phase 1: attestation/registration
* Logout
* Phase 2: assertion/login
* Recap

Dive into the world of secure and efficient user authentication and stay ahead in the ever-evolving landscape of web technology. Watch the [full course on the freeCodeCamp.org YouTube channel](https://youtu.be/lzelnAI914A) (1-hour watch).
