AI-powered chat applications are becoming an essential part of modern web development, enabling users to interact with intelligent conversational agents. Whether for customer support, virtual assistants, or educational tools, building your own AI chat app can be a rewarding and practical project. If you're interested in learning how to integrate powerful AI models into a web application, this course is perfect for you.

We just published a course on the [freeCodeCamp.org](http://freeCodeCamp.org) YouTube channel that will teach you how to build an AI chat application using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js). Developed by Harris from Coding Cleverly, this hands-on course will guide you through the entire development process. You'll work with cutting-edge AI tools like the ChatGPT API, Google’s BERT, and the DeepSeek R1 model. By the end, you'll have a fully functional AI chat app and a strong understanding of backend setup, API integration, and database management.

### What You’ll Learn

This course provides a structured approach to building an AI chat app from scratch. Here’s what you’ll cover:

* **Introduction** – Get an overview of the project and the technologies used.
    
* **npm init** – Set up the Node.js project with the necessary dependencies.
    
* **Backend Folder** – Organize the backend structure for efficient development.
    
* **MongoDB Integration** – Learn how to connect and manage data with MongoDB.
    
* **OpenAI Tokens** – Set up and securely manage API keys for ChatGPT integration.
    
* **MongoDB Issues** – Troubleshoot common database connection issues.
    
* **chat.js File** – Build the core chat logic to process and respond to user messages.
    
* **.env File** – Manage environment variables to keep sensitive data secure.
    
* **Frontend Folder** – Set up the React frontend for user interaction.
    
* **Testing Endpoints** – Ensure your backend API is working correctly.
    
* **Hugging Face Models** – Integrate AI models from Hugging Face for enhanced functionality.
    
* **Response Handling** – Manage and format AI-generated responses.
    
* **DeepSeek R1 Model** – Incorporate the DeepSeek R1 model for additional AI capabilities.
    
* **Results** – Test and refine your AI chat application.
    

### Why Take This Course?

This course is ideal for developers who want to gain practical experience in full-stack AI application development. You'll not only learn how to build a scalable chat application but also explore the latest AI technologies that power intelligent conversations. By working with the ChatGPT API, Google's BERT, and the DeepSeek R1 model, you’ll expand your knowledge of natural language processing and AI-driven web apps.

Whether you're a beginner looking to strengthen your MERN stack skills or an experienced developer eager to integrate AI into your projects, this course offers a valuable learning experience.
