In this week's episode of the freeCodeCamp podcast, Abbey chats with Madison Kanna, a full-stack developer who works remotely for Mediavine. Madison describes how homeschooling affected her future learning style, how she tackles imposter syndrome and failure, and how she helps others teach themselves to code.

Growing up, Madison's parents encouraged her to follow her curiosity - she once spent months learning everything she could about dinosaurs. She was 10. Once she decided to learn to code, this self-directed learning greatly came to her aid. 

After leaving college before getting her degree, Madison was inspired to get into the world of tech. Her sister was a developer in San Francisco, and Madison thought - if she can do it, why can't I? While she struggled to get into coding at first, she tried and tried again, and she was soon hooked.

Madison taught herself to code with free online resources and decided that she wanted to give something back to the community. She created her own free coding course, she mentors a number of junior developers, and she regularly sends out tips and resources.

When Madison's not learning more about the backend or working on projects for Mediavine, she loves meeting with other devs in her local community and spending time with her family.

In this episode, you'll hear some great advice about how to figure out your learning style and teach yourself to code, what books to read, how to use imposter syndrome and failure to your advantage, and how to create opportunities for yourself - among many other things.
