A linked list is a common data structure used in software development. It is also a frequent topic in technical coding interviews.

We just published a course on the freeCodeCamp.org YouTube channel that will teach you all about linked lists and prepare you to use them in coding interviews and programming projects.

Alvin Zablan from Structy developed this course. He has created many technical course, including one of the most popular Dynamic Programming courses on the internet.

In this course you will first learn about the theory behind the algorithms and then you will learn how to implement them with code. The algorithms will be taught with images and visualization to help you really understand how they work.

Just remember not to attempt to donate any linked lists 😀 (see comic below).

* What is a Linked List?
* Linked List Traversal

* Linked List Find
* Get Node Value
* Reverse List
* Zipper Lists
