## Who is the Microsoft 365 Fundamentals Certification for?

The Microsoft Power Platform Fundamentals certification is intended for people looking to demonstrate their knowledge and skills in using Microsoft Power Platform. This includes:

**Beginners in IT**: The certification is designed to be an entry-level credential, suitable for those with little to no prior experience in IT or Microsoft Power Platform. This makes it an ideal starting point if you're just beginning your IT career.

**Non-Technical Professionals**: This includes business analysts, data enthusiasts, and others who need to work with data, improve productivity, automate business processes, or create custom business applications but don't necessarily have a technical or programming background. The Power Platform offers a low-code or no-code approach that allows non-technical users to work effectively.

**Students or Job Seekers**: For those looking to break into the field of data analysis, business analysis, or IT in general, this certification can be a valuable addition to your resume, making you more attractive to potential employers.

Remember, although this is a fundamental certification, having a basic understanding of data processing and business value along with familiarity with the internet, cloud computing, and software as a service (SaaS) environments can be beneficial.
