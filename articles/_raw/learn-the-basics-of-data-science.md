Learn the basic components of Data Science in this beginner's course from Coding With Max. This course covers:

1.  Statistics: learn about the types of data you'll encounter, types of averages, variance, standard deviation, correlation, and more. 
2.  Data visualization: learn about why we need to visualize our data, and the different ways of doing it (1 variable graphs, 2 variable graphs and 3 variable graphs.) 
3.  Programming: learn about why programming helps us with data science including the ease of automation and recommended Python libraries for you to get started with data science. 

You can watch the full video course on the [freeCodeCamp.org YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6BghzuFLIg) (1.5 hour watch).
