OAuth 2.0 is an industry-standard authorization framework allowing third-party apps to access user data on another service (like Google or Facebook) without sharing passwords, instead using temporary, limited-scope access tokens for delegated access, enhancing security and privacy by restricting permissions.

We just posted a course on the freeCodeCamp.org YouTube channel that will provide you an introduction to OAuth 2.0.

Here are the sections in this course:

* Introduction to OAuth 2.0
    
* OAuth 2.0 in Simple Terms: The Valet Key System
    
* The Four OAuth Roles (Resource Owner, Client, Auth Server, Resource Server)
    
* Why PKCE (Proof Key for Code Exchange) Matters
    
* Project Setup & Folder Structure
    
* Building the Authorization Server
    
* Authorization Server: Code Imports & Initial Setup
    
* Building the Resource Server (API)
    
* Building the Client App (Authorization Code + PKCE)
    
* Running the Full System (Auth, Resource, Client Servers)
    
* Debugging and Fixing the JWKS Error
    
* Debugging and Fixing the Axios 400 Error
    
* Summary of Key Roles and Best Practices
