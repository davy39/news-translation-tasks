React Router is a powerful library that helps you build single-page applications with ease. It allows you to create multiple routes, nested routes, and handle transitions between them, all while maintaining a clean and organized codebase.

We just published a course on the freeCodeCamp.org YouTube channel that will teach you all about React Router 6.

In this course, you will build an Airbnb-style web app called "VanLife," dedicated to renting out travel vans for your next big road trip. Along the way, you will learn all the important parts of React Router 6, such as layout and index routes, nested routes, filtering results with search parameters, protecting routes for authenticated users, and more.

Bob Ziroll, Scrimba's Head of Education, created this course. It is intended to have heavy amounts of participation from you, the student.

Before taking this course, you should already be well versed in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React. But if you're ready to take your React Router skills to the next level, this course is for you.

The course is broken down into multiple sections, including an introduction to React Router 6, multi-page vs. single-page apps, setting up React Router with BrowserRouter, creating routes and paths, and building out the VanLife app. You'll also learn about the new Remix-inspired data router APIs, including Loaders and Actions.

The course is structured so that you can follow along with each lesson and build out the VanLife app in real-time. You'll also have the opportunity to participate in challenges that test your understanding of the material.

By the end of this course, you will have built a real-world app using React Router 6, and you'll be ready to tackle even more complex projects in the future.

So what are you waiting for? Watch the [full course on the freeCodeCamp.org YouTube channel](https://youtu.be/nDGA3km5He4) (10-hour watch).
