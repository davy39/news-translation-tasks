Scikit-learn is a free machine learning library for the Python programming language. We have released a full course on the [freeCodeCamp.org YouTube channel](https://youtu.be/pqNCD_5r0IU) that will teach you about machine learning using scikit-learn (also known as sklearn).

First you will learn about the basics of machine learning and scikit-learn. Then you will learn about some common machine learning algorithms and how to implement them with scikit-learn. Finally, you will learn about artificial intelligence and the science behind it.

This course was created by DLAcademy. Throughout the course, machine learning cocepts will be taught through practical examples.

Here are the topics covered:

* Installing scikit-learn
* Plotting a graph
* Identifying features and labels
* Saving and opening a model
* Classification
* Train / test split
* What is KNN?
* What is SVM?
* Linear regression
* Logistic vs linear regression
* KMeans
* Neural networks
* Overfitting and underfitting
* Backpropagation
* Cost function and gradient descent
* CNNs
* Implementing a handwritten digits recognizer

Watch the course on the [freeCodeCamp.org YouTube channel](https://youtu.be/pqNCD_5r0IU) (3 hour watch).
