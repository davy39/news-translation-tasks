If you want to delete a photo album on an iPhone, it only takes a few simple steps. 

In this short article, I will walk you through the six steps to delete an album from your iPhone. 

### Step 1: Go to the Photos app on your phone

First, you need to open the photos app.

It is important to note that if you delete an album it does not delete the photos from your phone. 

If you want to delete a photo, then you will need to choose the photo from the library and click on the trash can icon on the bottom right hand corner. 

## Why can't I delete all of the albums from my phone?

There are certain albums on the iPhone that you cannot remove. If you followed the steps above, you will notice that there is no red dash above the Recents or Favorites albums.

Those are the default albums that already come on the iPhone. Other default albums like Screenshots and Selfies cannot be deleted, either. 

You can only delete albums that you have created on your phone yourself.
