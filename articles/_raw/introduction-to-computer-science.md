Harvard's CS50 is one of the world's most popular computer science courses and we are proud to announce that we are posting it on freeCodeCamp's ad-free YouTube channel.

This course covers all the essential computer science concepts in an approachable way that is easy to follow for beginners. Whether you need a refresher or you are just getting started with programming, this is a great course to watch.

We'll be posting one lecture per day, starting with a lecture about computational thinking and Scratch. You can watch the first lecture on  [freeCodeCamp's YouTube channel](https://youtu.be/F0WoVEr0-44).‌
