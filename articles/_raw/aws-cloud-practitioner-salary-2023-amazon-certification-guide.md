More and more companies are making a shift towards cloud services and cloud-based systems these days, resulting in cloud computing being one of the most in-demand tech skills.

AWS is currently the most popular cloud service provider, as it owns around 33% of the cloud market.

Companies and organizations are looking for candidates with AWS skills. A way to showcase your AWS knowledge is by obtaining an AWS certification.

In this article, I will list the current AWS certifications and go into more detail about the Cloud Practitioner certification.

Let's get into it!

## What Is AWS? Amazon Web Services Explained

Amazon Web Services (or AWS for short) is a cloud computing platform offered by Amazon.

The platform provides on-demand cloud computing services such as hosting for servers, storage, database management, networking, and security, to name just a few of them.

Many businesses use AWS, including big companies such as Airbnb, Netflix, LinkedIn, and Twitter. With that said, it is also used for personal projects.

## What Is an AWS Certification?

An AWS certification is a credible way to demonstrate to an employer that you have the specific technical skills and competence to design, build, deploy, migrate, operate, and maintain well-architected AWS systems.

Obtaining an AWS certification and gaining cloud architecture expertise is a great way to kickstart a new career in tech and open doors in a fast-growing industry.

## An Overview of the Different AWS Certification Types – Levels of AWS Certifications

Currently, there are four types of AWS certifications.

There is one **foundational** level certification – the [Cloud Practitioner](https://aws.amazon.com/certification/certified-cloud-practitioner/?ch=sec&sec=rmg&d=1) certification.

There are three **associate** level certifications – the [Solutions Architect](https://aws.amazon.com/certification/certified-solutions-architect-associate/?ch=sec&sec=rmg&d=1), the [Developer](https://aws.amazon.com/certification/certified-developer-associate/?ch=sec&sec=rmg&d=1) and the [SysOps Administrator](https://aws.amazon.com/certification/certified-sysops-admin-associate/?ch=sec&sec=rmg&d=1) certifications.

There are also two **professional** level certifications – the [Solutions Architect](https://aws.amazon.com/certification/certified-solutions-architect-professional/?ch=sec&sec=rmg&d=1) and [DevOps Engineer](https://aws.amazon.com/certification/certified-devops-engineer-professional/?ch=sec&sec=rmg&d=1) certifications.

And lastly, there are six **specialty** level certifications – the [Advanced Networking](https://aws.amazon.com/certification/certified-advanced-networking-specialty/?ch=sec&sec=rmg&d=1), [Data Analytics](https://aws.amazon.com/certification/certified-data-analytics-specialty/?ch=sec&sec=rmg&d=1), [Database](https://aws.amazon.com/certification/certified-database-specialty/?ch=sec&sec=rmg&d=1), [Machine Learning](https://aws.amazon.com/certification/certified-machine-learning-specialty/?ch=sec&sec=rmg&d=1), [Security](https://aws.amazon.com/certification/certified-security-specialty/?ch=sec&sec=rmg&d=1) and [SAP on AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/certification/certified-sap-on-aws-specialty/?ch=sec&sec=rmg&d=1) certifications.

Choosing an AWS certification will depend on your experience level, professional goals, and interests.

Now, let's go into more detail on the fundamental AWS certification – the Cloud Practitioner certification.

## What Does an AWS Cloud Practitioner Do?

An AWS cloud practitioner is responsible for the organization's cloud computing architecture. They resolve scalability challenges and handle high-risk issues.

The practitioner understands AWS's core design principles and best practices for architecture.

They know how to design, build, deploy, and monitor applications on the cloud within AWS platforms.

They gather insights into end-users' problems and pain points, leverage software and hardware systems to address those problems, and come up with solutions.

## What Is the Average Salary for an AWS Cloud Practitioner?

According to data from Glassdoor, the estimated total pay for a cloud practitioner in the USA for 2023 is around $91,038 per year, with an average salary of $83,679 per year.

With that said, compensation is relative and will depend on your field and chosen industry, demand, previous experience, skills, and location. The average salary for a cloud practitioner may be higher in different regions in the USA and lower in other countries.

## AWS Cloud Practitioner Certification Prerequisites

The AWS Cloud Practitioner certification is a great place to start your cloud computing learning journey and a new career in the cloud.
