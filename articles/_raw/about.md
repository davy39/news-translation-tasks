If you add up all the people who use our learning platform, read our [publication](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news), watch our [YouTube channel](https://youtube.com/freecodecamp), and post on [our forum](https://forum.freecodecamp.org/) – we now help more than 1 million people every day.

You can [download our IRS Determination Letter here](https://s3.amazonaws.com/freecodecamp/Free+Code+Camp+Inc+IRS+Determination+Letter.pdf).

## How can I support the freeCodeCamp community?

Just forward one of your monthly donation receipts to [donors@fre](mailto:donors@freecodecamp.org)[ecodecamp.org](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/make-a-one-time-20-donation-to-freecodecamporg/) and tell us what you'd like us to do. We'll take care of this for you and send you confirmation.

## How long will it take me to finish each of freeCodeCamp's certifications?

Each certification takes around 300 hours of dedicated learning. Some people may take longer. These certifications are completely self-paced, so take as long as you need.

## Is freeCodeCamp a coding bootcamp?

No. A lot of coding bootcamps use freeCodeCamp as part of their curriculum, though.

## Is freeCodeCamp a replacement for a 4-year degree?

No. Please don’t drop out of college just to pursue freeCodeCamp. You can pursue both concurrently. Even though you don’t need a 4-year degree to work as a software developer, it still helps a lot.

## Should I complete all of the coding challenges in order?

We’ve put a lot of thought into how we introduce concepts. But you’re free to jump around.

## Do I have to use CodePen for the front end projects?

As long as your code is publicly viewable somewhere on the internet, and you have a live demo, you can use whatever tools you want.

## How did freeCodeCamp get started?

[Quincy](https://www.twitter.com/ossia) started the freeCodeCamp community in 2014. He is now just one of thousands of active contributors.

## I'm a teacher. Is freeCodeCamp an appropriate resource for my class?

Yes. Many high school, college, and adult ed programs incorporate freeCodeCamp into their coursework. We're open source, so no license or special permission from us is necessary. We're even building special tools for teachers.

## Can I live-stream myself working on freeCodeCamp challenges and projects? Can I blog about how I solved them?

Yes. We welcome this. Also, don't be shy about "spoiling" projects or challenges. The solutions to all of these challenges are already all over the internet.

## Can I create apps or tools based around the freeCodeCamp community and platform?

Yes. freeCodeCamp is open source (BSD-3 license), and most non-sensitive freeCodeCamp data is publicly available. But you must make it clear that you don't represent freeCodeCamp itself, and that your project is not officially endorsed by freeCodeCamp.

## Does freeCodeCamp have a mobile app?

Yes. You can learn on the go for free using one of freeCodeCamp’s mobile apps. Sign in and your progress will be sync’d with your freeCodeCamp account. You can download it on [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/freecodecamp/id6446908151) or [Android](https://play.google.com/store/search?q=freecodecamp&c=apps).

## Can I get a job at freeCodeCamp?

We're a small donor-supported charity. We've hired several prominent contributors from within the freeCodeCamp community, but you're much more likely to get a job at [one of the hundreds of companies](https://www.linkedin.com/school/free-code-camp/people/) where freeCodeCamp alumni work.

## Can I invest in freeCodeCamp?

We are a public charity, so technically you already own freeCodeCamp. Nobody can own shares of a public charity, and it cannot be bought or sold. So you'll continue to own a part of freeCodeCamp whether you like it or not. 😉

This said, [we would welcome your donations](https://www.freecodecamp.org/donate). The only way you can directly influence freeCodeCamp, though, is to roll up your sleeves and [contribute to our project](https://contribute.freecodecamp.org/#/).
