Transformers have revolutionized natural language processing, and now they are transforming computer vision as well. Vision Transformers (ViTs) apply the power of self-attention to image processing, offering state-of-the-art performance in tasks like classification, object detection, and image segmentation. But how do these models work under the hood? If you've ever wanted to build a Vision Transformer from scratch, this course is the perfect opportunity to dive in.

We just published a course on the [freeCodeCamp.org](http://freeCodeCamp.org) YouTube channel that will teach you how to build a Vision Transformer from the ground up. Tunga Bayrak, an experienced machine learning instructor, will guide you through the core concepts and hands-on implementation of ViTs. By the end of the course, you'll have a deep understanding of how AI models process visual data, along with practical skills to develop and experiment with your own Vision Transformer models.

### What You’ll Learn

This course covers the fundamental concepts and components that make up a Vision Transformer. Here's what you’ll explore:

* **Introduction to Vision Transformers** – Understand the motivation behind ViTs and how they differ from traditional convolutional neural networks (CNNs).
    
* **CLIP Model** – Learn about OpenAI’s CLIP model and how it bridges vision and language tasks.
    
* **SigLIP vs CLIP** – Compare SigLIP and CLIP to see how different models approach vision-language learning.
    
* **Image Preprocessing** – Discover how to prepare image data for a Vision Transformer.
    
* **Patch Embeddings** – Learn how images are divided into patches and converted into vector embeddings.
    
* **Position Embeddings** – Explore how Transformers maintain spatial information through positional embeddings.
    
* **Embeddings Visualization** – Gain insights into how embeddings represent image features.
    
* **Embeddings Implementation** – Implement the embedding process in code.
    
* **Multi-Head Attention** – Understand and build the core self-attention mechanism that enables Transformers to capture complex relationships in images.
    
* **MLP Layers** – Learn about the feedforward layers that refine feature representations in a ViT.
    
* **Assembling the Full Vision Transformer** – Put everything together to build a working Vision Transformer model.
    
* **Recap** – Review key takeaways and reinforce your understanding.
    

### Why Learn Vision Transformers?

Vision Transformers are rapidly gaining popularity in AI research and industry applications. Unlike CNNs, which rely on local feature extraction, ViTs can capture long-range dependencies in images, making them highly effective for complex vision tasks. Understanding how to build a Vision Transformer from scratch will give you a strong foundation in deep learning, self-attention mechanisms, and modern AI architectures.

This course will equip you with the knowledge and practical skills to work with Vision Transformers. Watch the full course on [the freeCodeCamp.org YouTube channel](https://youtu.be/4XgDdxpXHEQ).
