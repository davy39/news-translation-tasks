We’ve just posted a full-stack course on the [freeCodeCamp.org](http://freeCodeCamp.org) YouTube channel that will teach you to build a complete, production-ready movie streaming application named MagicStream, complete with AI-powered movie recommendations. This course is designed to give you a deep, practical understanding of a modern, powerful tech stack. Gavin Lon teaches this course.

The foundation of this project is built on high-performance technologies. On the backend, the course uses Go (Golang) paired with the lightning-fast Gin-Gonic framework to create a robust and efficient Web API. This combination is fantastic for handling concurrent requests, making the application quick and reliable. For the frontend, you'll be building a responsive and engaging user interface using React. All your data, from user profiles to movie details, will be stored in MongoDB, offering flexible and scalable data management. This combination of Go, React, and MongoDB provides a well-rounded and impressive skillset for any full-stack developer.

You'll learn to connect your Go backend directly to OpenAI’s models using the power of the LangChainGo library. This connection allows you to build a genuine, intelligent service that can analyze data and provide personalized movie suggestions. Also, you'll implement secure user authentication, including registration, login, and access token validation via middleware. Security is a priority, so the course even covers the best practice of storing access tokens in http-only cookies to prevent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks.

Once the core features are built and working, you’ll will learn to deploy the applicaiton. You’ll get hands-on experience taking your database live by deploying MongoDB to Atlas, hosting your Go/Gin-Gonic API on Render, and deploying the React client to Vercel.
