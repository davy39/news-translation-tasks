As technology is changing at a rapid pace, developers are moving to use new technologies and adopting more convenient frameworks for their web development needs. [Node.js is getting huge exposure](https://guide.freecodecamp.org/miscellaneous/get-started-with-nodejs/) from developers who love to use JavaScript for app development.

Being a developer, you can manage the same language for both client-side and server-side scripting, and this has brought huge adoption and use of Node.

Node.js frameworks are getting huge demand in the market and 2019 is bringing a lot more features and advantages. There are so many [top programming languages](https://www.technostacks.com/blog/top-programming-languages) available in the market but the best Node.js Frameworks of 2019 have drastically changed the development process.

#### **But before we go in deep discussion, it is important to understand what a Node Framework is**

Node.js is an open-source and a cross-platform JavaScript run-time environment that runs JavaScript code outside the browser. You cannot ignore it when you prepare a list of [JavaScript frameworks](https://technostacks.com/blog/javascript-frameworks/).

JavaScript is utilized chiefly for client-side scripting, in which scripts written in JavaScript are embedded in a website page’s HTML and run client-side by a JavaScript engine in the browser.

Node.js lets developers utilize JavaScript to get written command line tools. For server-side scripting, it runs the required scripts server-side to develop dynamic web page content before the page is driven to the available user’s browser. As a result, Node.js embodies a “JavaScript everywhere” paradigm, combining web application development across a particular programming language for both server side as well as client side scripts.
