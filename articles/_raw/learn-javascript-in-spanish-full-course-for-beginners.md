Welcome! If you speak Spanish and you want you learn JavaScript, you're in the right place.

freeCodeCamp just published a free 9-hour JavaScript course for beginners. You will learn everything you need to know to get started with JavaScript, a key programming language for web development and many other applications.

## 🔹 What is JavaScript Used For?

JavaScript is a programming language used around the world for web development. We can use it to create interactive websites, mobile applications, online games, web servers, and many other applications. 

[MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/First_steps/What_is_JavaScript) defines JavaScript like this: 

> **JavaScript** is a scripting language that enables you to create dynamically updating content, control multimedia, animate images, and pretty much everything else. (Okay, not everything, but it is amazing what you can achieve with a few lines of JavaScript code.)

**💡 Tip:** If you want to learn more about what JavaScript is used for, I highly recommend [reading this article](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/the-applications-of-javascript/).

Let's dive into the topics of the course.
