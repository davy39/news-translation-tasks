JavaScript is a versatile and powerful programming language primarily used to create interactive and dynamic content on websites. It is one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and CSS. While HTML provides the structure of web pages and CSS controls their presentation, JavaScript brings them to life by enabling complex features and behaviors.

We just published a new JavaScript course on the freeCodeCamp.org YouTube channel that is designed to take beginners through the basics of JavaScript with clear explanations and quiz sections.

Steven Garcia created this course. While we already have a lot of JavaScript courses on our channel, Steven is an excellent teacher so we wanted to bring this course to our community.

Here are some reason you may want to learn JavaScript:

1. **Ubiquity and Demand:** JavaScript is everywhere. It's supported by all modern web browsers and is used by nearly every website. Learning JavaScript makes you a versatile developer capable of working on both the client-side (front-end) and server-side (back-end) through environments like Node.js.
    
2. **Foundation for Other Technologies:** Understanding JavaScript is important for working with various popular libraries and frameworks such as React, Angular, and Vue.js. These tools are widely used in the industry to build sophisticated web applications.
    
3. **Career Opportunities:** Proficiency in JavaScript can significantly enhance your job prospects. As one of the most in-demand programming languages, JavaScript skills are highly sought after by employers looking to build and maintain modern, dynamic websites and applications.
    
4. **Versatility:** JavaScript is not limited to web development. It’s also used in game development, mobile app development (using frameworks like React Native), and even in building desktop applications (using frameworks like Electron).
