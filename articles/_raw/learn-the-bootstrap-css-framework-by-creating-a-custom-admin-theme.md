Bootstrap is a popular CSS framework that helps web developers create responsive, mobile-first websites. Learn to use Bootstrap in this full video course from Andrew Wilson.

In this intermediate course, you will learn Bootstrap by creating a custom admin theme from scratch using webpack.

First, Andrew demonstrates how to set up npm and webpack so he can configure Bootstrap's source files that are written in SASS. Next, he teaches the basics of Bootstrap and creates some basic templates that are common in admin forms. Finally, he customizes the theme by writing custom styling and overwriting some of the Bootstrap JavaScript.

Watch the full video below or on the [freeCodeCamp.org YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RyTRgQ7k6QE) (3 hour watch).
