A large number of websites – almost 135,000 – have been built on Laravel rather than other PHP frameworks. So why is this the case? Let's find out.

## Laravel Rules

Laravel scores better than other web frameworks because of its advanced features and development tools that facilitate rapid web application development.

Laravel also helps website developers simplify their development process with clean and reusable code. It's one of the few frameworks that has the flexibility and rich features to make it a perfect platform for creating websites and online applications.

### Laravel's Market Share

The companies using Laravel are most often in information technology services, real estate, and the retail industry. 

Now, let’s learn some of the technical advantages of Laravel and why it is still the best PHP framework to use in 2020 for software developers.

## 1. MVC Architecture For Exceptional Support & Performance

Laravel comes with the model-view-controller (MVC) architectural pattern. It is easy to use and thus offers an extremely convenient way to build large or small business applications. With it, web artisans can organize big projects with more than five files for improved maintainability.

When you have to work on a large project, you have to deal with a lot of unstructured code. Using MVC can simplify your coding structure and make it easier for you to work with. 

MVC support also makes it easier to find files in their logical directories when working on large projects. With it, you can control the process of how your application appears in the real world, so you can improve the app for branding purposes.

## 2. Template Engine For Outstanding Layouts

Programming tasks often involve the use of a template engine that works as a tool for handling a lot of textual data in web applications. Briefly, the template engine connects the data model, processes the code given in the source templates, and directs the output to a specific text file or stream.

Laravel comes with the Blade templating engine. It’s a powerful, lightweight, and pre-installed template engine that helps web developers make the process of development smooth and easy with its outstanding layouts.

The Blade template engine allows data display and extending layouts without affecting the application's performance and speed. It helps you create innovative and amazing layouts using the feature of content seeding. 

In addition to this, it provides its own structure to create and view a file that includes conditional statements and loops. You can also use the master template to create a simple layout that can be extended by other files.

## 3. Artisan CLI For Utterly Simple & Fast Commands

Laravel has its own Artisan command-line interface (CLI) that lets you make your development process simple, easy, and fast. It uses a powerful Symfony Console component for building applications. The tool also helps in data migrations, database management, and you can create [skeleton code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skeleton_(computer_programming)), models, controllers, and more.

Laravel's Artisan tool eliminates those tedious and repetitive coding tasks that developers previously had to perform manually. In addition, it can be used to generate MVC files and manage data configurations by creating its own commands.

It is one of the few Artisan types that's made up of all documented items that are required for app authentication services.

## 4. Eloquent ORM For Easy Interaction With App Database

You can easily enhance the performance of any business application using [Models](https://laravel.com/docs/7.x/eloquent) in Laravel. It is the only PHP framework that provides an easy way of building and customizing these models by using the Eloquent ORM.

ORM stands for object-relational mapper, and Laravel’s Eloquent ORM is awesome. As the name suggests, it allows you to maintain an easy interaction with your app database objects using an eloquent or expressive syntax.

It is one of the best ORM tools for web developers, as it allows them to perform database queries with simple PHP syntax. So there is no need to spend a lot of time writing complex code in SQL, which will save you a lot of time.

## 5. Adequate App Testing Features

Laravel comes with a specific set of features for performing unit tests on your web applications/mobile applications through PHPUnit. It automatically set up the file phpunit.xml for performing unit testing in web development. 

It runs tests on two directories including Feature and Unit. The first, Unit tests, are for small coding portions. Feature tests are for larger codebases with several objects.

Laravel can run multiple unit tests at the same time to make sure all your new changes are tested properly. So, when it comes to testing your application, unit tests are better because they make it easy for developers to perform app testing.

If used properly, Laravel’s testing features make your application bug-free and extremely performant.

Laravel costs less compared to other PHP frameworks because of its MVC architecture and Unit testing features. These allow web developers to build business applications that are scalable and within a limited budget.

## Wrapping Up

You can try out more new features of [Laravel 7.12](https://laravel-news.com/laravel-7-12-0) such as Truehosts Middleware, foundation function, rebinding method, and the use of default URLs in Routing. Truehosts Middleware, for example, lets you create a bulk of logics. Also, you can fix coding errors using the rebinding method and default URLs in routing.

These are some of the new features of Laravel 7.12 that will improve your web application's performance, functionality, scalability, and security. So now I hope you are planning to create a Laravel web-based application in 2020!
