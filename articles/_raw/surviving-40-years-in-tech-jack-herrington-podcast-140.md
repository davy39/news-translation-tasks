On this week's episode of the podcast, I interview Jack Herrington. As a kid he had to work to overcome Dyslexia and didn't have good enough grades to get into college. Despite this, he's worked as a software engineer for more than 40 years at companies like Nike, Adobe, and Walmart.

He also runs the popular Blue Collar Coder YouTube channel.

We talk about:

* How Jack struggled with Dyslexia, had terrible grades that couldn't get him into college, but got really into GameDev in the early 1980s
    
* Early developer job opportunities that took his family from his home town in Pennsylvania to Melbourne Australia
    
* How he started blogging as he learned, and ultimately published 6 programming books
    

Can you guess what song I'm playing on my bass during the intro? It's from a 1979 New Wave song.
