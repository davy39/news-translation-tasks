The core driving force behind the freeCodeCamp community is simple: We want to help more people understand technology and be able to harness its power. In a word, we want to increase **access**.

As such, we take accessibility seriously. Many people in the freeCodeCamp community, including many of our contributors, live with disabilities. And in ensuring that freeCodeCamp is accessible for them, we help make freeCodeCamp more usable for everyone. Because after all, good accessibility is just good usability.

We are making every effort to ensure that our site meets W3C-WAI Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG). As we upgrade the curriculum and platform, we are working toward complying with WCAG 2.0 Level A/AA and Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act.

This said, we recognize that our learning platform is still a work in progress. Some people may still find it difficulty to fully access some of our learning resources.

If you have any questions or suggestions about the accessibility of this site, please contact us at support+accessibility@freecodecamp.org. We will make every effort to respond to your request in a timely manner.

Happy coding.
