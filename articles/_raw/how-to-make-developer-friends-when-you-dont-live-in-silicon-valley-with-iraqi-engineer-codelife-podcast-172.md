On this week's episode of the podcast, freeCodeCamp founder Quincy Larson interviews software engineer and live coding streamer Code;Life.  
  
For those of you watching the video version of this interview, she lives in Iraq and she uses a 3D avatar to protect her identity.  
  
We talk about:

* Training language models to work well with low-resource languages from Africa and the Middle East
    
* Growing up in Iraq and her early experiences with computers and the internet
    
* How streaming yourself coding can be a good way to practice your skills, update your knowledge, and motivate fellow devs
    
* How to participate in coding competitions and hackathons even if you feel intimidated
