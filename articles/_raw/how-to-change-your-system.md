## Step 3: Edit the Computer Name

You will see your computer name at the top, and can click into the text field to update it.

Once you've changed it to whatever name you want, you just need to click Edit.

You can close out of System Preferences.

Now when people see you on AirDrop, they'll see your new AirDrop name.
