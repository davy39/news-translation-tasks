On this week's episode of the podcast, I interview Jessica Chan AKA Coder Coder. She's a software engineer has worked in the field for more than a decade. Interestingly, she studied photography in school and never took a programming class.

We talk about:

* How she and her sister ran a dial-in Bulletin Board System (BBS) back in the pre-web days
    
* How her first year as a dev she "was just living in abject fear of losing my job."
    
* How she stayed at her first developer agency job for 7 years, and went from imposter syndrome afflicted newbie to getting promoted
    
* Her philosophy on creating programming tutorials: "You don't have to be on the cutting edge. I don't operate on the cutting edge."
    

Can you guess what song I'm playing on my bass during the intro? It's from a 1993 rock song.
