Use case diagrams define the scope of a system. But use cases can also help you to design your product development organization.

Here's a use case diagram, showing the use cases of an online flight booking system:

![Online Flight Booking System](https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--pCQTizdb--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://thepracticaldev.s3.amazonaws.com/i/gz3j1ob8tcftqwivu9gc.png)

As you can see, the diagram shows the goals that users have: an _end customer_ wants to _book a flight_. The diagram does not show the steps to get to the goal, like searching for a flight.

An agile team should deliver value, independent of other teams. A goal-level use case is such a unit of value. When agile teams are responsible for entire use cases, the need for communication with other teams is limited.

The use case _Book flight_, for example, is valuable on its own. It ties to the users' need to get from A to B.  That's why it is a selling point for the software.
