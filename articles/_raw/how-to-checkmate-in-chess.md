Ready to turn your chess advantages into decisive victories? We've just released a new beginner-level course on the [freeCodeCamp.org](http://freeCodeCamp.org) YouTube channel that focuses on the most important phase of the game: the endgame.

This course is designed for players who already know the basics but want to deepen their strategic understanding. You'll learn how to recognize and execute common checkmate patterns, a key skill for increasing your chances of winning.  

Ihechikara Abba teaches this course. He has an ELO rating of 2200, which places him in the top 1% of chess players worldwide.

This course is divided into two main sections to build your skills:  

* **Algebraic Chess Notation:** First, you'll master the standard method for recording and communicating chess moves. Understanding notation is essential for studying games and improving your play.  
    
* **Endgame and Checkmate Patterns:** The second section covers powerful endgame techniques. You'll learn classic checkmates, including the two-rook endgame, queen and king patterns, Anastasia's Mate, Smothered Mate, and more.  
    

Watch the full course now on [the freeCodeCamp.org YouTube channel](https://youtu.be/1AX7_aPWmbE) (1-hour watch).
