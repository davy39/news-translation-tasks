_You will build this._

This coruse is perfect for new developers who want to improve their skills. Building projects is a great way to enhance your web development capabilities and Ademir is a great teacher for beginners.

The course is designed to guide you step-by-step in crafting the game board with precision, bringing the snake to life, and populating the board with randomly generated food items. As the course progresses, you will delve into the dynamics of the game, learning how to elegantly control the snake's movement across the board.

One of the key skills you will acquire is the ability to enhance the snake's size as it consumes food, adding a layer of complexity and excitement to the game. The course will also teach you how to incrementally increase the speed of the snake

Beyond the gameplay mechanics, the course also covers essential aspects like scorekeeping. You will learn effective techniques to track the score, monitor snake collisions, and importantly, display and record high scores.
