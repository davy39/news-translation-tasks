## Who is the Microsoft 365 Fundamentals Certification for?

*  You are new to cloud and want to learn the fundamentals and benefits of adopting cloud services in general, and the software as a service (SaaS) cloud model specifically.
* You are a business user, administrator, or IT professional
* You want to understand the capabilities of Microsoft 365 and how to build basic solutions, and deploy cloud services in your organization
* You are a Senior Cloud Engineer or Microsoft 365 Administrator who needs to reset or refresh their knowledge after working for multiple years.  


## Overview of the Microsoft 365 Fundamentals 

The Microsoft 365 Fundamentals covers the following:

* The cloud fundamentals e.g., Cloud Concepts, types of cloud computing, etc.
* The Core Microsoft 365 Services and Concepts E.g., SharePoint Online, Microsoft Viva, Teams
* Endpoint and Deployment options in Microsoft 365 E.g., Endpoint Manager, AVD, etc
* Security, Compliance, Privacy, and Trust in Microsoft 365 E.g., MFA, Defender 365
* Microsoft 365 Pricing of subscriptions, licenses, and support offerings for services

## **How do you get Certified?**

You can get the certification by paying the exam fee and sitting for the exam at a test center partnered with Microsoft.

Microsoft Azure is partnered with Pearson Vue and PSI Online who have a network of test centers around the world. They provide both in-person and online exams. If you have the opportunity, I recommend that you take the exam in-person.

Microsoft has [a portal page on Pearsue Vue](https://home.pearsonvue.com/Clients/Microsoft.aspx) where you can register and book your exam.

That exam fee is **$**99 **USD**.

## **Can I simply watch the videos and pass the exam?**

Its strongly recommended to utilize practice exams before sitting the real exam.

ExamPro has multiple [paid practice exams](https://exampro.co/ms-900) along with other study materials to increase your chances of passing.
