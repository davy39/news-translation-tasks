## Conclusion
YouTube automatically saves your search and watch histories in order to keep showing you what they feel you like to watch. But sometimes you wonder why they know so much about you, and you might start worrying about your privacy.

In the same vein, there are times you get recommendations you don't like all because you once stumbled on a video that doesn’t align with your current needs.

That's why I put this article together to help you clear your search and watch histories, auto-delete them, and pause them.

Thank you for reading!
