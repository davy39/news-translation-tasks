FastAPI is a Web framework for developing RESTful APIs in Python. It is a great choice when you want to build an app based on microservices.

We just published a course on the freeCodeCamp.org YouTube channel that will teach you how to develop microservices app using FastAPI.

In this course, you will create a simple microservices app using Python FastAPI with React on the frontend. You will learn how to use RedisJSON as a Database and dispatch events with Redis Streams. RedisJSON is a NoSQL database just like MongoDB and Redis Streams is an Event Bus just like RabbitMQ or Apache Kafka.

Antonio Papa from Scalable Scripts developed this course. He has a bunch if experience working with a variety of frontend and backend frameworks.

Here are the sections in this course:

* App Demo
* Inventory Microservice Setup
* Redis Cloud
* Connect to Redis Cloud
* Products CRUD
* Payment Microservice Setup
* Internal Http Requests
* Background Tasks
* Redis Streams
* Frontend

Watch the full course below or on [the freeCodeCamp.org YouTube channel](https://youtu.be/Cy9fAvsXGZA) (1.5 hour watch).
