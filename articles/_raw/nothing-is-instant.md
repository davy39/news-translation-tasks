I'm currently a Software Engineer in one of the fast growing startups in my country.

I'm an open source contributor.

I'm a writer on Medium and for freeCodeCamp.

I also published my own Mobile Application with my own back-end server.

Some people might look at me and think that I'm an ideal Software Engineer. You might think that I have always been like this, able to do everything like I was born with the talent to do so.

But in reality, I am not everything that people see. Even now, everything I am doing is all for the sake of **growing**.

_I am not an overly smart person._ I used to score pretty badly during my university life. And I don't have a good long term memory.

_I am not a fast learner._ Some people might only need to be explained something once to fully understand it. Meanwhile I might need two or three explanations.

_I was not even a good writer_. I always struggled doing those assignments which asked you to write a story in 1000 words kind of thing.

_And especially, I am not a confident person_. _I have huge **Impostor Syndrome**_.

Fortunately, I am able to compensate for all those things that I lack. I'm able to get myself back up every time I am feeling down.

Still, nothing comes instantly. Everything comes with hard work and **progress**. It takes times and dedication to overcome it all.

In this article, I will share several things that enable me to overcome my own weak points.

## 1. Make learning a habit

Some people read books every day. Some people watch videos or listen to tech podcasts for learning, or even take online courses. 

As for me, I tend to lose focus on long reads and stop halfway through on online courses. But I found reading short tech articles on Medium or freeCodeCamp effective for me. **Finding the best way for you to learn** is the first step into learning.  
  
**Make it become your habit.** Whether it's having 5 minutes to read every day in your morning toilet, or even time to read before bed. As for me, I always commute with public transportation and I tend to spend my time finding a good 5 to 10 minute article to read.  
  
Learning keeps me updated everyday. Having a head start has helped me keep myself together so I don't get left behind on track. 

**Learning is a lifetime journey for us.**

## 2. Make coding a habit (too)

Yes, it does sound **crazy**. When you are doing it, a lot of people will think that you need to get a life. Why did I say that? Because I am living proof of that case!  
  
But for me it's a **part of making myself better**. It keeps me from getting rusty and also it helps a lot when I am trying to learn new things. After all, hands-on execution really helps me a lot when learning new things.   
  
Making coding into a habit is not an easy thing - for god's sake it is coding! It's full of weird magic and unknown realms. All that aside, you need to **find some parts of it that you like**. As for me, I love the **challenge of exploring new things,** which is never ending in coding.  
  
Just because you like it doesn't mean you'll make it a habit. What really helped me back then was doing [100 days of code](https://medium.com/free-code-camp/my-journey-in-completing-100-days-of-code-e657428b1fa6). It helped me get into the habit of opening a computer everyday and at least looking at some code. 

## 3. Sharing is caring

When you are learning so much, there is always **time to give back**. This really helps boost your confidence. It's also one of the better ways for you to learn, as **sharing will help to fill any knowledge gap** in thing you are trying to share.   
  
There are plenty of ways in which you can try to share your thoughts: writing a blog or article is one of the ways (as I am doing right now). Giving a technical talk, or even simply mentoring your peers are other ways.   
  
Also, remember those stack-overflow questions you have been copy-pasting?   
**It is now the time for you to give back to the tech community and share your own though also.**

## 4. Look into an open-source project

**GitHub** is full of interesting things. Try to take your time exploring and you might find a lot of interesting things. Some are complicated super-libraries, some are not even code, only [list of open-source APIs](https://github.com/public-apis/public-apis) which you can use. There are even some [joke repositories](https://github.com/kelseyhightower/nocode) there for a laugh.  
  
Contributing can even start from making an [issue](https://help.github.com/en/articles/creating-an-issue) on a repository. **Every big thing always starts small.** 

## 5. Impostor Syndrome? Learn from it!

**Have you ever felt like you are a fake**? Feel scared that everybody will figure out that you are just a scam, like you don't actually belong here? Yup, that's what **impostor syndrome** is.   
  
Most people certainly have felt this before, especially in the fast growing field of technology. In reality, this is very common and it is actually a good sign if you are having it. This means you are in a place where **you know enough to know that you do not know enough things**.   
  
The thing about impostor syndrome is, **don't let it overwhelm you with negativity**. Let it **drive you and become a motivation** for you to grow and be better. 

### Final thoughts

Now, even after all that, you might wonder if I have successfully dealt with all my weaknesses. If I have already accomplished enough. If it's time yet for me to stop.

The answer is a big **NO.**

**You never stop in growing.** The moment you stop growing, you will start dying inside. The world is vast and you'll never have enough knowledge.

Success is a long journey ahead, nothing is ever instant. Focus more on the **progress** rather than your destination and your path will feel lighter. Keep up your **consistency** and you will surely reach your destination. Even then always remember to **give yourself a break when the time comes**.

Thanks for reading through my article! I do hope that it will be useful for you! I will be very happy if it is! :)
