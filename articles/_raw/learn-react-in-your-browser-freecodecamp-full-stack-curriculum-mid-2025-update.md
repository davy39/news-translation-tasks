Hey campers! The freeCodeCamp community is still very hard at work on the rest of the coursework for our [full stack curriculum](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/full-stack-developer/).

It’s only been a few months, but already there are many campers going full-force through these new lessons and programming challenges.

I’m excited to share our next wave of updates with you all.

## New Curriculum Coursework

We have just released three new sections of the curriculum: The React Hooks and State section, the Performance section, and the Testing section.

This new coursework includes:

* 50 lecture videos
    
* a dozen workshops and labs
    
* three new review blocks
    
* and a bunch of coursework to keep you on track with your learning goals (while we work to finish the remainder of the Full Stack curriculum.)
    

Some of the projects you’ll build include:

* a fully playable Tic Tac Toe game
    
* a color picker
    
* and a superhero application form
    

## Exams

We know many of you are eagerly awaiting the release of the exams at the end of each module. These are nearly ready.

We’re also building our own custom exam environment that you can use to take these exams. This will strike a balance between respecting privacy and preserving academic integrity.

## What’s Next?

The community is now focused on the CSS Libraries and TypeScript modules next. We’re also building Python modules.

We have a lot of stuff coming out in the next few months.

A super early sneak peek of some of the projects coming soon:

* build your own RPG character
    
* a trading card game
    
* a medical data validator
    
* and more 🏕️
