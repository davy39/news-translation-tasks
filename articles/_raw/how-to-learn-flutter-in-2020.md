Flutter is a trending technology this year. This article will suggest some free and paid ways to learn how to develop iOS and Android applications with Flutter.

## Are you interested in mobile application development?

If your answer is yes, you are reading the right article! Maybe you don't know about Flutter yet, but don't worry – I wrote an article about [what flutter is and why you should learn it this year](https://herewecode.io/blog/what-is-flutter-and-why-you-should-learn-it-in-2020/).

> Flutter is a free and open-source mobile UI framework created by Google and released in May 2017. In a few words, this allows you to create a native mobile application with only one code. It means that you can use one programming language and one codebase to create two different apps (IOS and Android). – [What is Flutter and Why You Should Learn It in 2020](https://herewecode.io/blog/what-is-flutter-and-why-you-should-learn-it-in-2020/)

In this post, I share with you two types of content, free or paid. I tried to find excellent resources to support every type of learner (videos, courses, books, tutorials, and so on).

Before we start, I also wrote an article about [whether you should you learn to code with paid or free content - and why?](https://herewecode.io/blog/should-you-learn-programming-with-paid-or-free-content-and-why/) If you don't know what type of content is the best for you, I recommend that you read that article before reading this one.

So let's get started. I tried to explain each resource with a small paragraph. All information came from the description of the associated website. As you can imagine, I haven't tried all these methods. If you need more details, I invite you to visit the linked website.

You can also learn Flutter with the [Google Codelabs](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/?cat=Flutter) website. The website provides a guided, tutorial-based, hands-on coding experience. I have just discovered this site. You can even use it outside of Flutter. It references all the Google technologies with many tutorials to help you use them.

### Documentation

Something I love about Flutter is the [documentation](https://flutter.dev/docs). It’s complete and can be helpful when you are learning or developing an application.

The documentation goes through many topics, such as:

* How to start with Flutter
* All the available widgets
* The API docs (libraries docs)
* A cookbook with a lot of tutorials
* Some examples of apps
* The Flutter Youtube channel

### Books

* [Flutter Succinctly](https://www.syncfusion.com/ebooks/flutter-succinctly)

By searching through the Flutter documentation, I found this book. The author creates a fully functional app, which allows you to get a clear understanding of the framework. This book is accessible whether or not you have mobile development experience.

* [Flutter Tutorials Handbook](https://kodestat.gitbook.io/flutter/)

This cookbook contains recipes that demonstrate how to solve common problems while writing Flutter apps. Each method is standalone and can be used as a reference to help you build up an application. It can be used in addition to the Flutter documentation. Many examples are listed there.

### HereWeCode

I plan to create tutorials on Flutter soon. To stay up-to-date, you can follow [the Youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCSRuzHhjUaAnBb6_rmlr10g) and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/gaelgthomas/). Feel free to let me know what topics and tutorials you want to see.
