> It is better to be a samurai in a garden than an agricultural worker in a war - Miyamoto Musashi

In this article, I’ll share my story.

When I was younger, I thought I was destined to be a failure in life. To be isolated from everyone. But years later, I realized I was actually destined for success.

I went from wasting thousands of hours playing video games to giving a lecture to medical professionals called “Trustworthy AI: The Role of Small Models in Critical Systems.”

And I went from being told I was dumber than most people based on an IQ test I took as a 14 year old low self-esteem kid, to becoming a frequent contributor to freeCodeCamp. I’ve written articles on interpretable AI, applied math, and advanced tech. And these articles have now reached more than 200,000 people worldwide.

**And this is just the beginning.**

When it comes to education, I owe gratitude to three people and the organizations they lead:

* Salman Khan, founder of Khan Academy
    
* Quincy Larson, founder of freeCodeCamp
    
* Andrew Ng, co-founder of Coursera and founder of DeepLearning.AI
    

I also owe a lot to the great author of the book Atomic Habits: An Easy & Proven Way to Build Good Habits & Break Bad Ones – James Clear.

I’m sharing my story to inspire others who are struggling in their lives just like I was.

I’m also writing this for those who know me or will know me personally, so that they can understand where my determination comes from and why I am relentless.

> "As it turns out, it was that very rock bottom that became the firmest foundation I had ever planted my feet on." — Mandy Hale

Five years ago, I was in a different place and was a completely different person.

Like many teenagers, I started playing video games and became addicted to them. Over time, games became an escape from reality and all my problems, including my bad grades and many other issues.

At age 14, I still held ambitions in my heart. I dreamed of being someone who would help others, maybe as a doctor or an engineer.

But after an IQ and vocational guidance test, I was told that I was incapable of doing these things. That I lacked the intelligence needed. That it was unrealistic for me to pursue these types of degrees.

Eventually, and because of many comments, opinions, and expectations of others, I began to believe in this lie for years.

Over time, depressed and constantly escaping reality, my grades plummeted and I got worse and worse. And this only made the prospect of going to college less and less likely.

By 11th grade, I was:

* Extremely shy and anxious
    
* Struggling academically
    
* Over 2000 hours in video games on two games alone:
    
    * 1000 hours in GTA V
        
    * 1000 hours in Destiny 2
        

2000 hours equals nearly 83 days.

This means that in these two games, I lost more than two months of my life.

But from these wasted hours, I learned English. This became crucial when learning online.

In January 2020, I was tired of everything. In particular, I was sick of the misery of always being at the bottom and of so much negativity towards and around me.

So I made these vows to myself for the rest of my life:

* Never again would I worry or care about what other people say about me.
    
* I would no longer accept the limitations imposed by others or myself on my growth.
    
* And as for the limitations I imposed on myself, I would rethink to see if they were really impossible or if I could actually conquer them.
    

As a result, I started relearning and learning everything by myself to make sure I succeeded in the national exams.

## My Transformation: Learning Triple Integrals and Programming

> *"The expert in anything was once a beginner."*  
> — Helen Hayes

I started going through chemistry exercises in the 10th and 11th grades using books from school and YouTube videos. In two weeks, I relearned or learned most of the material I needed to know.

I started doing the same for mathematics, something I always found hard due to a lack of basic foundational mathematics knowledge.

I found it hard, that was, until I discovered Khan Academy.

With the Khan Academy, I rebuilt myself, going from struggling with basic math to mastering double and triple integrals, all within five to six months.

My method was simple:

* Study a little bit every day.
    
* Take detailed notes
    
* Redo quizzes or units tests until I scored more than 90%
    
    * For topics that I found harder or failed to understand, I did the practice exercizes
        
* Use YouTube to close any knowledge gaps
    

For example, for [Algebra I](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/algebra), where I started to relearn math, I say how many units there were. Each unit had a certain number of topics. As of 2025, Algebra I has, from units with mastery exercises, 89 topics.

For those 89 topics, I watched the videos and did the quizzes. According to my scores, I would either go on to the next video (if I felt confident), or stop, rewatch the video, go through the same material on YouTube, do practice exercises, and then try to do the quiz again.

I decided that I needed to do at least three topics every day. This way, by doing 3 topics per day, I could finish Algebra I by the end of one month.

But I was so motivated and so focused on it that I did more than 3 topics per day.

I did the same for Algebra II, and all the others until [College Calculus BC](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/ap-calculus-bc).

Some days, I completed more than 8 topics. Other days, I struggle to even do 2. But I made sure that I mastered mathematics and its foundation for the rest of my life.

This was not just about grades. It was about regaining belief and confidence in myself.

I also read many books, primarily self-help, to make myself better. Over the years, I have started reading fewer self-help books and have started focusing on non-fictional books that explain to me how the world works.

### **COVID-19: Accelerating My Learning in Programming and Machine Learning**

When the pandemic hit, I started accelerating my learning in other areas, like programming and physics. In many online classes, I didn’t pay attention as well as I should’ve – and I found myself prioritizing self study on topics I found more important. And I always used my time to learn more about programming.

I learned Python and C through free YouTube courses for beginners on freeCodeCamp’s channel.

This was where I first learned Python.

%[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfscVS0vtbw&pp=ygUTZnJlZWNvZGVjYW1wIHB5dGhvbg%3D%3D] 

And C:

%[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJgsSFOSQv0&pp=ygUOZnJlZWNvZGVjYW1wIEM%3D] 

Soon after exploring C programming, I realized that programming languages are just tools. Once you master one, others come more naturally.

I studied data science tutorials on the web and on YouTube. This way, I learned how to import Python libraries in virtual environments. I also began building projects with Python libraries I found interesting and made it a habit to explain every line of code to myself as if I were the teacher.

For example, I started working with the [scikit learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/index.html) Python library to make simple linear and logistic models that could make make predictions.

I also decided to explore Deep Learning and taught myself how to work with [Arduino](https://www.arduino.cc/) and circuits. In other words, I learned how to train the architecture of neural networks to predict things.

I found this hard to master compared to triple integrals at the time!

But this way, I understood one very important thing about Deep Learning: to truly understand and master it, I needed to know, deeply, some difficult mathematics concepts. And I also needed to learn quickly about the new research coming out.

## One of the Best Choices in My Life: Why I Choose Electrical and Computer Engineering

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1743426438035/92ee17a4-c537-4922-82cc-cbb42c564baa.jpeg align="center")

> *"Opportunities multiply as they are seized."*  
> — Sun Tzu

After completing the Portuguese national mathematics exam in the 12th grade, I chose Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE). I choose this area, because it would challenge me and allow me to gain the skills to learn and apply new mathematics by myself without anyone teaching me.

It was also broad:

* If I liked, I could follow an electrical engineering area. Like circuits, power systems, or telecommunications.
    
* If an electrical engineering subarea was not in my best interest, I could follow a computer science path or apply math in banking or other areas where people who know applied math work.
    

The ECE degree also allwed me to unite the following areas:

* Advanced Mathematics
    
* Programming (from low-level like assembly and C to high-level like Python)
    
* Physics (circuits, robotics, communication systems)
    

I wanted to become someone who not only mastered knowledge but could also create new systems and ideas from it.

I knew that I was laying the foundation for something greater than just academic success.

### **What Did I Gain Exactly?**

Over time, I learned the many skills I needed to understand all the new AI research coming out after completing AI specializations.

I also learned hard math and applied mathematics areas such as:

* Partial differential equations: how they can represent and model real phenomena, like the economy of a country.
    
* Pure harmonic analysis: Fourier and Laplace transformations and how integral transformations allow us to see problems in other ways.
    
* Complex analysis: application of derivatives and integrals in a complex domain, with real and imaginary numbers.
    
* Numerical analysis: how math used to approximate analytical math is used by computers to get faster results.
    
* Signal and control theory: how the architecture of systems is studied to ensure rocket, train, and car control systems are stable, despite possible disturbances in the systems.
    

Not to mention physics classes like:

* Classical mechanics
    
* Electromagnetism
    

While these topics may not be applied in depth to AI, learning them helped me develop an incredible intuition into systems thinking. It also greatly improved my ability to learn hard STEM concepts on my own.

## Being Restless and Determined: My Work Ethic in University

![Me at 18 years old](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1743421252923/58fa0581-1312-4577-b186-b61a0d7ecac1.png align="center")

> "Success is the sum of small efforts, repeated day in and day out." — Robert Collier

I adopted a very rigorous work ethic.

When my work ethic failed to achieve what I wanted, I adapted with more knowledge and learned very deeply what I did wrong so as not to repeat it.

For example, in the first semester, my first grades were not the best. So, I read:

* Deep Work
    
* The Effective Executive: The Definitive Guide to Getting the Right Things Done
    
* How to Become a Straight-A Student: The Unconventional Strategies Real College Students Use
    

These books taught me how to focus and prioritize what needed to be done. This became essential as I entered one of the most demanding phases of my life.

In addition, I used Notion as a management system and Google Calendar as a schedule system.

Every week, I transferred next week's tasks from Google Calendar to Notion. This way, I never forgot anything and never worried about forgetting anything.

I had two simple scalable systems that worked very well for managing everything I did.

In the scheduling system, I would place certain events on repeat, for example:

1. Every week:
    
    * Read the top articles of the week on Subreddits dedicated to programming and others topics so I could keep learning and growing. Same with communities on Stack Exchange Network.
        
    
    * Read new articles on IEEE Spectrum and learn as much as possible about what is happening currently.
        
2. Every two weeks:
    
    * Plan my studying according to time available, as well as all class and other resources I could get for tests, projects, and exams.
        
3. Every month:
    
    * Review my annual objectives and prioritize what was important and urgent to do in that month. Also, review new opportunities that appeared that aligned with my objectives this year and in my life.
        

This way, I was always aligned and efficient. And all this was from a Notion database.

Very often, I started working at 8:00am and continued until around 9:00 or 10:30am, when my classes often started. At that time, I studied, did student organization work, completed online courses and specializations, worked on AI projects, wrote freeCodeCamp articles, and many tasks.

I went beyond studying just the subjects from my degree:

* I also studied history, economics, and geopolitics to understand the hidden incentives that shape the world.
    
* I developed the habit of studying the architecture of things, from political systems to technology, understanding how they work to design better systems.
    
* I attended many free online and university events to learn as much as possible.
    

I also treated weekends as opportunities to grow and work, and did not stop. This was not possible 100% of the time, but most days I was able to do so.

In this way, I completed Coursera’s prestigious Deep Learning Specialization, a very important achievement in my journey.

I also read many books and listened to podcasts while taking public transportation, ensuring that no time was wasted.

## My Projects While in NOVA FCT: AI Projects, International Student Organizations, and freeCodeCamp Articles

> *"The strength of the team is each individual member. The strength of each member is the team."*  
> — Phil Jackson

International student organizations often offer opportunities that are rarely found in local college clubs.

These student organizations are also often better managed than some local clubs, which can sometimes suffer from internal politics focused on titles rather than making a real contribution to society.

For this reason, I sought international organizations that pushed members towards real impact and development.

After a while, I became interested in BEST (Board of Engineering Students of Technology), a large international organization of student organizations spread over 80 groups around European universities. I joined the local group, BEST Almada, one of the 80 local BEST groups across Europe that helps foster the development of students through courses and events.

I also became deeply involved in the IEEE, the world’s largest non-profit professional association, where I served as the Vice-Chair of the IEEE NOVA Student Branch. Currently, I contribute nationally in the IEEE Portugal Section by creating videos for social media.

Thanks to IEEE, I was able to go to the IEEE Melecon conference in Porto last year to speak with some amazing scientists and researchers.

Here’s a key thing I learned from IEEE that I want to share: Communication, alignment of expectations between everybody, and knowing how to navigate social dynamics is crucial for any project or initiative to succeed. Of course, the culture of the organization and a lot of other variables are important as well. But I believe communication is one of the most important and critical factors.

Along this path, I worked on projects like Eurostatify AI, which aimed to provide European public data insights and hidden patterns that are accessible to researchers and policymakers. I also led the Doctor AI Project as part of a Hackathon in March 2023, where I developed two AI bots using Flutter and the ChatGPT API to help doctors make better decisions.

Each step helped me forge myself into someone capable of inspiring and leading others. I also taught complex topics in my freeCodeCamp articles, such as how CPUs work in depth, interpretable AI, quantum AI, and even how to design a control system for rockets.

I was involved in local student clubs before I realized the value of joining international organizations. In Europe, these organizations bring unique opportunities, are usually better managed than local groups. They’re a great place for developing soft skills as well.

So in the end, joining international student organizations was one of the best decisions of my university life.

## My Personal Philosophy at 21 Years Old and View on Envy and Negativity

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1743425739851/135f7a2a-edab-48a4-91ee-e8aa3ed8c416.jpeg align="center")

> *"Freedom lies in being bold."*  
> — Robert Frost

Here’s one thing I’ve learned over the years: You need to make your own path. Chasing social status and falling prey to social pressures isn’t worth it, and you shouldn’t be blinded by these things. True freedom comes from defining your own path. Developing relationships with professors and mentors, learning from books, and taking advantage of solid free learning resource are all things that can help you go further in life.

But what about envy and negativity from others?

Well, unfortunately these will always be part of our lives. Being envious is human nature, and various forms of negativity will likely continue to exist. Anyone who works and achieves any level of success will inevitably attract envy and negativity.

The best response is not to react and to ignore it completely. Just keep growing.

Some people will disappear, mock you, envy you, or hate you – but just try to let it all go. Keep walking your path.

Time is precious. Don’t waste it on:

* Meaningless opinions
    
* Video games
    
* Distractions
    

I find it sad that, despite living in such an exciting time, and despite unprecedented access to knowledge and education, advances in technology, and immense global connectivity, some people still choose to hate and be envious of others. But as I said before, it’s human nature and there is little we can do about it.

Just remember: you have opportunities today that previous generations could only dream of. Take advantage of them to the fullest and worry about your own personal growth.

> *"I am not a product of my circumstances. I am a product of my decisions."*  
> — Stephen R. Covey

At 21, I am finishing my degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering at NOVA FCT.

So far:

* I’ve been accepted into the Silicon Valley Fellowship Program: Only 18 out of 600 are accepted to visit Silicon Valley's top companies and universities.
    
* I’ve delivered a talk to doctors about AI called "Trustworthy AI - The Role of Small AI Models in Critical Systems.". Before this, I delivered other smaller talks.
    
* I’ve completed Coursera AI specializations such as the Deep Learning Specialization from DeepLearning.AI and Reinforcement Learning Specialization from the University of Alberta.
    
* In IEEE (the largest non-profit professional association in the world), I served as the vice chair of my faculty IEEE NOVA SB student branch, and I am now an IEEE PT Officer, creating videos for social media.
    
* I’ve had twenty articles published on freeCodeCamp since 2023 that have accumulated around 200,000 views. They are related to advanced applied math, AI, and technology. (Link below)
    
* I’ve been recognized as a Top Open Source Contributor for freeCodeCamp in 2022, 2023, and 2024
    

## Final Thoughts: Have an Adaptive Grand Strategy for Your Life

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1743421784759/80ba16f2-fef7-4a4d-82b9-9287d7b43e53.jpeg align="center")

Silicon Valley Fellowship post about me

> *"What you do makes a difference, and you have to decide what kind of difference you want to make."*  
> — Jane Goodall

My life objective was and still the same when I was 14, 7 years ago:

* Help as many people as possible. In their opportunities to make their life’s better and in making society better for future generations that will come after mine.
    

**My strongest advice for anyone: Have a grand strategy for your life.**

A grand strategy is a type of long-term strategy in which nations align power and resources to achieve their objectives. You must align your actions, skills, and knowledge towards your purpose.

I used to be afraid of public speaking and so many other things. Not anymore.

Now, I know I am destined to contribute, inspire, and leave a mark on other people's lives for the better.

If you feel stuck, remember:

* You can change! It will be hard. Many people will not want it.
    
* Ignore all that and focus on yourself.
    

It takes effort, patience and courage, but it is possible.

**Thanks to all organizations for the opportunity to contribute to society and grow as a person:**

* NOVA School of Science and Technology and its student association, AEFCT
    
* IEEE Portugal Section
    
* Silicon Valley Fellowship
    
* BEST and BEST Almada
    
* Magma Studio
    

I also want to thank all the university professors at NOVA FCT who taught me, especially the ones from the department of electrical and computer engineering.

Finally, I want to express my gratitude to Portuguese society. Not long ago, in Portugal, pursuing higher education, especially in STEM, was inaccessible to many. Thanks to the efforts of past generations, today, young people like me can pursue these opportunities and contribute back to society.

**This is just the beginning of my impact on society.**
