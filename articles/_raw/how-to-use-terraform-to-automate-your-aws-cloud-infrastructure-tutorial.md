Terraform is an open-source infrastructure as code software tool. It is used for building, changing, and versioning infrastructure safely and efficiently. We've released a [full course on the freeCodeCamp.org YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLB_c_ayRMo) to help you learn how to use Terraform.

In this course from Sanjeev Thiyagarajan, you will learn how Terraform can be utilized to manage and automate your AWS cloud infrastructure. The course starts at the absolute beginning: setting up a free AWS account and installing Terraform on your machine.

Next, you will learn how to deploy a resource through Terraform and learn the core concepts of its use. You'll even get a chance to setup a simple web server in AWS.

Here are the sections in this course:

* AWS Setup
* Windows Setup
* Mac Setup
* Linux Install
* VSCode
* Terraform Overview
* Modifying Resources
* Deleting Resources
* Referencing Resources
* Terraform Files
* Practice Project
* Terraform State Commands
* Terraform Output
* Target Resources
* Terraform Variables

You can watch the full course on [the freeCodeCamp.org YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLB_c_ayRMo) (2 hour watch).
