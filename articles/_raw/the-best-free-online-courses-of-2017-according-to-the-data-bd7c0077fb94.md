The results are in! In 2015, [Class Central](https://www.class-central.com/) first published a ranking of the [best online courses of the year](https://www.class-central.com/report/best-free-online-courses-2015/) based on reviews from our users. I did it [again in 2016](https://www.class-central.com/report/best-free-online-courses-2016/). Now I’m back with a list of the best online courses of 2017. Like last year and the year before, this year’s list is based on thousands of reviews written by our users.

The methodology is simple. I made a list of all the courses that were offered for the first time in 2017 (which comes out to be over 2,000 courses), ranked the courses by the Bayesian average of their ratings, and filtered out the ones with less than ten reviews.

As you will see below, some of the highlights of this year’s ranking include: a new course by the team that created [Learning How To Learn](https://www.class-central.com/course/coursera-learning-how-to-learn-powerful-mental-tools-to-help-you-master-tough-subjects-2161), one of the most popular MOOCs of all time; a new course from Andrew Ng, one of the founders of the modern MOOC movement; and, for you Italian speakers, three new courses from Italy’s University of Naples Federico, which started offering its MOOCs on the edX platform in 2017.

### So without further ado, here are 2017’s best free online courses:
