Typography is one of the most important aspects of good design. It is especially important for web designers.

We just published a course on the freeCodeCamp.org YouTube channel that will teach you all you need to know about creating good typography as a UX Designer.

Hope Armstrong developed this course.

You will learn how to choose a typeface, what to look for when laying out type, how to create typographic hierarchy, how to layout type, and how to create responsive typography.

First you will get an introduction to typography. This stage will give you the foundation to build upon as you learn more about typography.

Next you will learn how to select, install, and use fonts on your computer and in your designs. You will learn about font weights, styles and sizes as well as the importance of horizontal and vertical spacing to create typographic rhythm and flow.

After learning about fonts, you will learn how to create typographic hierarchy with style, weight, size, positions, capitalization and color, and how to combine different typeface to create variety and interest.

Finally, you will learn about responsive typography, grid systems, variable fonts, and the fine details of type.
