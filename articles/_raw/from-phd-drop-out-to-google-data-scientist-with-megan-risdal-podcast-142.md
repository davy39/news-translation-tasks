On this week's episode of the podcast, I interview Megan Risdal. She's a data scientist and Product Manager at Kaggle, Google's Data Science competition platform.

Megan works closely with the global data science community, and on Google's Gemma open models project.

We talk about:

* Google's Kaggle, which hosts 300k open data sets and runs data science competitions each week that anyone can participate in.
    
* How people talk in academia VS how people talk in tech
    
* Stack Overflow VS Kaggle – Megan contrasts what it was like to work on these two "communities of practice"
    
* Linguistics and its importance in LLMs and AI research
    

Can you recognize the song I'm playing during the intro? It's a punk song from 1994.
