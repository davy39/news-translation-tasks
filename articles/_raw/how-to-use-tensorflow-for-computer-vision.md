TensorFlow can do some amazing things when it comes to computer vision.

We just published a full course on the freeCodeCamp.org YouTube channel that will teach you how to use TensorFlow 2 for computer vision applications.

Nour Islam Mokhtari created this course. Nour is a Machine Learning Engineer and experienced teacher.

The course shows you how to create two computer vision projects. The first involves an image classification model with a prepared dataset. The second is a more real-world problem where you will have to clean and prepare a dataset before using it.

_MNIST Dataset with labels_

Here are the topics covered in this course:

* Why learn Tensorflow
* We will be using an IDE and not notebooks
* Visual Studio Code (how to download and install it)
* Miniconda - how to install it
* Miniconda - why we need it
* How are we going to use conda virtual environments in VS Code?
* Installing Tensorflow 2 (CPU version)
* Installing Tensorflow 2 (GPU version)
* What do we want to achieve?
* Exploring MNIST dataset
* Tensorflow layers
* Building a neural network the sequential way
* Compiling the model and fitting the data
* Building a neural network the functional way
* Building a neural network the Model Class way
* Things we should add
* Restructuring our code for better readability
* First part summary
* What we want to achieve
* Downloading and exploring the dataset
* Preparing train and validation sets
* Preparing the test set
* Building a neural network the functional way
* Creating data generators
* Instantiating the generators
* Compiling the model and fitting the data
* Adding callbacks
* Evaluating the model
* Potential improvements
* Running prediction on single images
