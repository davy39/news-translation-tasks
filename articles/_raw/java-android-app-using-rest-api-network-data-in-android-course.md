REST APIs can be used to add a lot of functionality to your Android Apps.

We've released a full course on the freeCodeCamp.org YouTube channel that will teach you how to create a Java Android app using a REST API.

You will learn how to build an Android app with Java that handles JSON data from a REST API service. The app uses the Volley library to create a weather app using API data. 

The course was created by Shad Sluiter. Shad is a professor of computer science at Grand Canyon University. Over the past 20 years he has taught students from grade 6 to senior citizens in many aspects of technology.

This course includes advice on building a RequestQueue, designing a Singleton, and using callbacks for async network communications. 

You will also learn to use the Volley library methods JsonArrayRequest and JsonArrayObject to parse a JSON file.

Here are the sections in this course:

* REST API explained: JSON vs XML
* Introduction to the Android Weather App
* Design the Layout
* Button onClick Listeners
* Request JSON Data with Volley
* Singleton Request Queue in Volley
* Callbacks for Async Requests
* Fetch One JSONObject from an Array
* JSONArrayRequest with Volley
* Fetch JASONArray with Volley
* Get Forecast by City Name

Watch the full course on [the freeCodeCamp.org YouTube channel](https://youtu.be/xPi-z3nOcn8) (2.5 hour watch).
