APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) play an important role in enabling communication between different software systems. However, with great power comes great responsibility, and securing these APIs is necessary to protect sensitive data and maintain the integrity of your applications.

We just published a course on the freeCodeCamp.org YouTube channel that is designed to equip developers with essential knowledge and practical skills to protect API servers from various threats and vulnerabilities.

### Course Overview

This comprehensive course covers key concepts and best practices for keeping your API servers secure. From understanding cross-origin resource sharing to implementing rate limiting, you'll learn how to defend against common attack vectors and build robust, secure API infrastructures.

The course is divided into six main topics, each addressing a critical aspect of API security:

1. **Cross Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)**
    
    * Understand the importance of CORS in preventing unauthorized API access
        
    * Learn how to implement CORS policies effectively
        
2. **Error Disclosure**
    
    * Master the art of proper error handling
        
    * Discover techniques to prevent leaking sensitive information through error messages
        
3. **Information Leak Prevention**
    
    * Identify common sources of information leaks in API servers
        
    * Implement strategies to minimize unintended data exposure
        
4. **Secure Cookie Management**
    
    * Learn the risks associated with insecure cookies
        
    * Explore best practices for implementing secure cookie policies
        
5. **Path Traversal Protection**
    
    * Understand the dangers of path traversal attacks
        
    * Implement safeguards to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive files
        
6. **Rate Limiting**
    
    * Discover the importance of rate limiting in preventing DDoS attacks
        
    * Learn how to implement effective rate limiting strategies
        

This course is taught by Anthony Aragues, the Head of APIsec Labs. With over 20 years of experience in the security industry, Anthony brings a wealth of knowledge from many perspectives. He offers a well-rounded approach to API security.

Here are some reasons to take this course:

* **Comprehensive Coverage**: Gain a thorough understanding of critical API security concepts
    
* **Practical Skills**: Learn techniques you can immediately apply to your own projects
    
* **Expert Instruction**: Benefit from the knowledge of a seasoned security professional
    
* **Free and Accessible**: Available on freeCodeCamp's YouTube channel at no cost
