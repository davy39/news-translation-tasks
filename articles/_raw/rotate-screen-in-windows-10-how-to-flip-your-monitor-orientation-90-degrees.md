Windows 10 has a built-in feature that lets you flip or rotate your monitor screen just like you can do on your smartphone.
 
In this article, I will show you how to flip or rotate the monitor of your Windows 10 machine in several orientations such as reverse-landscape, portrait, and reverse-portrait.

## Why Would you Want to Flip Your Monitor Screen?

Well, you might have mistakenly pressed some button combination on your keyboard and your computer screen now appears flipped. 
 
Or, if you deal with lots of infographics, or you are a designer, there might be times when you want to view a design or other project in portrait and reverse-landscape modes. And to do that, you'd need to flip your computer screen.

## How to Flip Your Monitor Orientation in Windows 10

**Step 1**: Right-click in a blank space on the Windows Desktop and select Display Settings:

**Step 4**: To keep the changes you made, click the “Keep Changes” button. To revert to the previous orientation, click “Revert”. 

If you don’t click either of the two options, the orientation will be reverted to the previous one in 15 seconds.

### Keyboard shortcuts to flip your screen in Windows

You can also use some keyboard shortcuts to rotate your monitor screen:

- `CTRL` + `ALT` + `Up Arrow` for landscape
- `CTRL` + `ALT` + `Right Arrow` for portrait
- `CTRL` + `ALT` + `Down Arrow` for reverse-landscape
- `CTRL` + `ALT` + `Left Arrow` for reverse-portrait

Keep in mind that these keyboard shortcuts have been disabled in the latest version of Windows 10. But they should still work on previous Windows versions.
