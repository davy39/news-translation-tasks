Are you interested in combining your love for chess with your passion for coding?

We just posted a comprehensive video course on the freeCodeCamp.org YouTube channel that will teach you how to code your own chess game with JavaScript and Angular. Even if you're not familiar with Angular, this course provides a step-by-step approach that ensures you can follow along and learn effectively.

You will learn how to integrate the Stockfish API, one of the most powerful chess engines available. You'll learn how to interact with this tool, enabling your chess game to offer formidable opposition in computer mode. This interaction involves fetching the best possible moves from the Stockfish engine, allowing players to test their skills against advanced AI.

Understanding how to implement and utilize APIs like this one will not only enhance the functionality of your chess game but also provide invaluable experience in integrating external services into your applications.

Here are the key things you will learn in this course:

* **Introduction to Chess Programming**: Start with the basics of creating a chess app using an object-oriented model.
    
* **Building Blocks of Chess**: Learn to code different pieces like the Bishop, Knight, Queen, Rook, King, and Pawn, each with unique moves and capabilities.
    
* **Chessboard Dynamics**: Explore how to create a chessboard in Angular, manage game states, and display everything in the browser effectively.
    
* **Advanced Game Mechanics**: Implement essential chess rules and moves such as castling, en passant, and pawn promotion.
    
* **Interactivity and AI Integration**: Integrate the powerful Stockfish API to enable games against a computer opponent, learning how to communicate with this engine via a REST API.
    
* **User Interface Enhancements**: Use Angular Material to polish your application, making it not only functional but also visually appealing.
    
* **Gameplay Features**: Add advanced gameplay features like move history, game over conditions, sound effects, and navigation through game moves.
    

The course also covers the technical aspects of chess, such as implementing checks for stalemate, checkmate, and the 50-move rule. You'll also learn how to handle special game situations like threefold repetition and insufficient material, ensuring your chess game is as robust as any traditional platform.

This project is not just about coding – it's about solving problems, implementing rules, and creating an engaging user experience.
