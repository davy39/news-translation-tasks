Learn CSS in this complete 83-part course for beginners. Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) tell the browser how to display the text and other content that you write in HTML.

This course I created will teach you everything you need to know to get started with CSS3, including flexbox and CSS grid.

CSS has been adopted by all major browsers and allows you to control:

* color
* fonts
* positioning
* spacing
* sizing
* decorations
* transitions

You can watch the video on the [the freeCodeCamp.org YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieTHC78giGQ) (1.5 hour watch)‌.
