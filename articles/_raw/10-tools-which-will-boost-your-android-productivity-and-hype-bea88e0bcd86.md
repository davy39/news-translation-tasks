The main purpose of this post is to list and describe tools (mainly **free** ones), which allow you to boost your productivity, efficiency, and increase the hype among your product owners and managers.

To every single tool (or groups of tools) I will add annotations like:   
**[FREE]** or **[FREE/PAID]** or **[PAID]**.

Let’s not waste time!

[**1. Android Tool for Mac**](https://github.com/mortenjust/androidtool-mac) **[FREE] —** when I discovered this tool, it just made my day. It is completely free and allows you to:

* Record screen videos,
* take screenshots,
* install (sideload) APKs,
* take bug reports,
* use common scripts.

You can see the main menu in the picture below. You can simply take   
a screenshot or start recording a video, by clicking on a proper icon.

The tool offers also quite powerful preferences which you can see below:

![Image](https://cdn-media-1.freecodecamp.org/images/bYVsIl4bQ7CCZAgFBtwqMPd1r7OCCzVxly1-)

What is really important to me is that it can also **create a gif** for you, besides mp4 format.

You can set the quality of videos and gifs and also adapt Android **status bar** to the needs of the video or screenshot.

One of disadvantages is that the **Android tool is available only for OSX / MacOS**.

**2. [Vysor](https://www.vysor.io/) [FREE/PAID]** — this is a Chrome app, compatible with all operating systems¹. It gives you a possibility to operate your physical device from your desktop.

![Image](https://cdn-media-1.freecodecamp.org/images/NeNk8HtFK0pt-eDkq73ysFZB1Rjo4u4Q2J12)

As per above gif, you can use a mouse pointer to click and scroll in the device. Your computer keyboard would also work.

There are two versions of the app:

* _Free_ — it offers mirroring and controlling your Android device and taking screenshots.
* _Pro_ — it gives you high quality mirroring, taking screen videos, fullscreen mode, going wireless and drag & drop functionality.

Honestly speaking, the **combination of the Android Tool for Mac and Vysor Free covers most of the use cases**. You can do a live demo, you can take screen video and share it after, or record a gif. However, for the sake of having a really good quality of streaming / mirroring, I think it is worth it to go Pro, especially since it costs just $1.99/mo.

To sum up, **use these two apps and make your demo perfect!** It will make your stakeholders happy as well!

**3. [Genymotion](https://www.genymotion.com/) [FREE/PAID]** — I think everybody knows Genymotion. If not, this is a powerful Android emulator.

![Image](https://cdn-media-1.freecodecamp.org/images/KHch2RdYtVivRNEISZOBZFzb54rmTTTpgTzP)

> Genymotion is an AOSP, ported to VirtualBox (by integrating its drivers). It is compiled directly in x86. So it can run directly on your CPU/GPU without any abstraction or translation. It makes a huge difference in term of performance.²

The tool offers:

* Compatibility with Android SDK tools, Eclipse and Android Studio (there is also a plugin which I listed in my last article about [Android Studio Tips & Tricks](https://medium.com/@mmbialas/50-android-studio-tips-tricks-resources-you-should-be-familiar-with-as-an-android-developer-af86e7cf56d2#.yjqhphptd))
* lots of predefined emulators,
* using laptop webcam as the video source for your Android camera,
* testing your app with various charge levels and seeing how it handles those use cases,
* using the GPS widget to test your geolocation-based apps,
* running UI tests like Espresso,
* screencasting (taking screenshots, recordings etc.).

In addition, you can install Google Services applications, like Goole Play Store and enjoy the full Android experience.

Unfortunately, every rose has its thorns and **Genymotion is an extra-paid solution** (just think about all these features, which I listed above).   
[The cheapest plan](https://www.genymotion.com/pricing-and-licensing/) costs 99€/year.

Update 4th Feb 2017: **Genymotion is also available for free**, but for personal use only. You can download it [here](https://www.genymotion.com/fun-zone/).

**Another [FREE] alternative** is to use built-in [Android emulator](https://developer.android.com/studio/run/emulator.html). Since 2015 it works pretty well, as it uses Google Intel x86 images. I like its smoothness, intuitiveness and that it is well-integrated with Android Studio.

**4. [Postman](https://www.getpostman.com)** **[FREE/PAID]** — this tools is just **awesome**. I’ve used it for 3 years now, initially as a Google Chrome extension, then as a native app. Postman helps you to be as productive and efficient as possible, while working with APIs.

![Image](https://cdn-media-1.freecodecamp.org/images/5-s8U9OJOdWDpJ7svml2ByL14PFtLWNmROja)

Basic features include³:

* Compact layout,
* HTTP requests with file upload support,
* formatted API responses for JSON and XML,
* HATEOAS support,
* image previews,
* request history,
* basic Auth and OAuth 1.0 / 2.0 helpers,
* autocomplete for URL and header values,
* key/value editors for adding parameters or header values. Works for URL parameters too,
* using environment variables to easily shift between settings. Great for testing production, staging or local setups,
* keyboard shortcuts to maximise your productivity,
* using collections to organise requests,
* documenting requests inside collections. You can even store entire HTML notes. Postman uses Bootstrap so you can use it too to style your notes,
* download and share collections with your team of developers.

**What I really like about Postman, is:**

* The ability to write pre-request scripts (e.g. for generating and passing timestamps) and then play with results (write tests or save results for another API call),
* having multiple environments (dev, stage / preprod, prod etc.),
* grouping API calls in collections,
* syncing collections across the team (you can achieve it _manually_ by exporting the collection or _buy_ a PRO version to sync it across all teammates automatically),
* great documentation.

For me the free version is enough, but you can of course read more about product comparison and pricing plans on the [official website](https://www.getpostman.com/products).

**5. [Sequel Pro](https://www.sequelpro.com/)** **[FREE]** — a fast and easy-to-use Mac database management application for working with MySQL databases. You can check it out on [Github](https://github.com/sequelpro/sequelpro).

**Main reasons why I like it:**

* Quick and direct access to MySQL Databases on local and remote servers,
* it is a native app,
* good documentation,
* open-source project.

Unfortunately, there is only OSX / MacOS version available for now. Still, [MySQL Workbench](https://www.mysql.com/products/workbench/) might be considered as a **free Windows alternative**.

If you use PostgreSQL, you can use [**PSequel**](http://www.psequel.com/)**,** which provides a clean and simple interface to perform common PostgreSQL tasks and it is free.

**6. [JD-GUI](http://jd.benow.ca/)** **[FREE]** — it is a standalone graphical utility that displays Java source code of `.class` files. You can browse the reconstructed source code and for instance, access to methods and fields. I always use it when   
I decompile Android apps.

![Image](https://cdn-media-1.freecodecamp.org/images/zYfDi5ECDh0khu6sJ1h-XzCz0OjgVHjAH82X)

The tool is open-source and the code is available on [Github](https://github.com/java-decompiler).   
There are also 2 plugins to use with it:

* [IntelliJ](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/idea/plugin/7100-java-decompiler-intellij-plugin) (last changes: 28 March 2014),
* [Eclipse](https://github.com/java-decompiler/jd-eclipse) (last changes: 23 April 2015).

**7. [Android Asset Studio](https://romannurik.github.io/AndroidAssetStudio/)** **[FREE]** — who hasn’t heard about [Roman Nurik](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/10-tools-which-will-boost-your-android-productivity-and-hype-bea88e0bcd86/undefined)? His contributions to the Android world are just exceptional. One of them is Android Asset Studio which is

> a web-based set of tools for generating graphics and other assets that would eventually be in an Android application’s res/ directory.

The set is available on [Github](https://github.com/romannurik/AndroidAssetStudio) and consists of:

* [Launcher icon generator](https://romannurik.github.io/AndroidAssetStudio/icons-launcher.html)
* [App shortcut icon generator](https://romannurik.github.io/AndroidAssetStudio/icons-app-shortcut.html)
* [Notification icon generator](https://romannurik.github.io/AndroidAssetStudio/icons-notification.html)
* [Simple nine-patch generator](https://romannurik.github.io/AndroidAssetStudio/nine-patches.html)
* [Generic icon generator](https://romannurik.github.io/AndroidAssetStudio/icons-generic.html)
* [Action bar / tab icon generator](https://romannurik.github.io/AndroidAssetStudio/icons-actionbar.html)
* [Launcher icon animator](https://romannurik.github.io/AndroidIconAnimator/)

**8. [Material Colors for Mac](https://github.com/romannurik/MaterialColorsApp) [FREE]** — another cool tool from Roman Nurik. This is a Material Colors palette viewer accessible from the Menu Bar. You can download it from [here](https://github.com/romannurik/MaterialColorsApp/releases/download/v1.1.0/MaterialColors-1.1.0.zip).

The only disadvantage is that Windows users can not use it. You can check out how it works below:

![Image](https://cdn-media-1.freecodecamp.org/images/yvUswE0W-4NbElBQ7Vag165H8AOFiU0uYCWx)

**9. [Spectacle](https://www.spectacleapp.com/) [FREE]** — this is a tool for Mac user who struggle with lack of move / resize / operate functionality of windows, which we know well from Microsoft Windows. You can see below how it works:

![Image](https://cdn-media-1.freecodecamp.org/images/O0sIvZfBjlsKkwoY6wiAnoc3DJ7qiEAws3rX)

**[PAID] alternative** of my choice is [Moom](https://manytricks.com/moom/). I use it on a regular basis. It costs $10 and I consider it a more powerful solution.

**10. [f.lux](https://justgetflux.com/) [FREE]** — a tool that makes the colour of your computer’s display adapt to the time of a day. It is warm at night and looks like sunlight during the day. If you work at night, this tool will do the job! I use it everyday. It helps me to stake awake, even after working late hours. What is more, I noticed that I wake up more relaxed.

**What I like most about f.lux:**

* Useful preferences with 4 presets for your needs (as you can see, I use _Working late_ preset)

* Notifications:

* It allows me to sleep well.

That was the very last point! I hope you enjoyed the article. Please let me know, if you know any useful tool which boosts your Android productivity!

¹ _Actually you can also install Vysor which is wrapped into a native app. The link is [here](https://plus.google.com/110558071969009568835/posts/Ub7QKu2Pddu)._
