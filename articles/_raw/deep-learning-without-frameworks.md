Finally understand how deep learning and neural networks actually work. In this talk that I gave recently at Moscow PythonConf++, you will learn the theory of neural networks.

Instead of teaching about a framework such as Karas or TensorFlow, I give an overview of the methods behind those frameworks. First, I explain the key concepts of deep learning.  Then, I live code a neural network using Python without using any frameworks. This will help you understand the concepts at a deeper level.

You can watch the video on the [the freeCodeCamp.org YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7n9t1cBei8) (75 minute watch).‌
