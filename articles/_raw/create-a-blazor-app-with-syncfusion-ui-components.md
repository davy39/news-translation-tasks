Syncfusion provides a UI component suite for building powerful web, desktop, and mobile apps.

We just published a full course on the freeCodeCamp.org YouTube channel that will teach you how to harness the power of the Syncfusion UI components from within a Blazor server application. You'll also learn to integrate the Microsoft Identity technology into the Blazor application to leverage login, registration, authorization and authentication functionality.

Gavin Lon developed this course. Gavin is an experienced developer and teacher. He has created many popular courses both on his own channel and the freeCodeCamp.org YouTube channel.

Using the Syncfusion components allows a developer to include powerful UI functionality in an application through the implementation of simple declarative code.

You will learn to integrate the relevant Syncfusion components together into a fully functioning web based sales management application that could be of great use to a sales department, and is also a pleasure for the user to operate. And you will do it all with with minimal amounts of declarative code.

The sales management application is cross platform and fully responsive when viewed on multiple screen sizes.
