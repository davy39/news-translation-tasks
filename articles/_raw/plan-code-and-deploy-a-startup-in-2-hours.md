There are a bunch of tutorials about creating projects. But it can be hard to figure out how everything goes together from the initial idea to deploying the project.

In this video tutorial from [Aaron Jack](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/plan-code-and-deploy-a-startup-in-2-hours/_aaronjack) of [Code Drip](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCRLEADhMcb8WUdnQ5_Alk7g), you will learn how to plan, code, and deploy a full stack JavaScript app in just two hours. 

This video covers:

* Creating a React front end w/ Hooks
* Coding a simple Node-Express API
* Starting a cron worker to fetch data
* Developing a simple filtering algorithm
* Using Redis and node-redis
* Deploying with NGINX on a DigitalOcean droplet

You will learn to build a job board app that could be a real startup that people use. The app will use public APIs to pull job posting data from various sources. You will learn everything from building the app to buying a domain name and deploying using Digital Ocean.

You can watch the full video below or on the [freeCodeCamp.org YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lauywdXKEXI) (2 hour watch).
