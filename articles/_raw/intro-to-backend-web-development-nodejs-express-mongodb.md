Backend development involves building the server-side "brain" of a website that manages user data, authentication, and database communication.

We just posted a course on the freeCodeCamp.org YouTube channel that will teach you how to construct a basic backend for a website using popular technologies like Node.js, Express.js, and the MongoDB NoSQL database.

The tutorial covers the core components of backend development, walking you through the initial server setup, database connection, and code structure using a model, route, and controller pattern.

You will learn to build practical APIs for user authentication, including password hashing, as well as full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations to manage data. Finally, the video demonstrates how to utilize Postman to test your server's requests and ensure your APIs are functioning correctly.

This course was developed by Shivani. She is part of Hack Club. Hack Club is a global non-profit organization that creates a community for high school students interested in coding and making things with technology.
