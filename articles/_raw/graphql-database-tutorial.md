GraphQL has been transforming the way that developers interact with APIs and data-driven applications. And there is a good chance you will need to know about it as a developer.

We just posted a full GraphQL course on the freeCodeCamp.org YouTube channel. In this comprehensive course, designed especially for those new to GraphQL, you will learn the knowledge and skills to create robust and efficient data-driven applications.

The Net Ninja created this course. He is a prolific technical course creator and is also one of the most viewed GraphQL instructors on the Internet. So he is the perfect person to teach this new GraphQL course.

GraphQL is a query language for your API, and a runtime for executing those queries by using a type system that you define for your data. Developed by Facebook in 2012 and released as an open-source project in 2015, GraphQL provides a more efficient, powerful, and flexible alternative to the traditional REST API. Instead of having multiple endpoints for different data needs, with GraphQL, you can request exactly what you need, all in one query. This can result in faster and more precise data retrieval.

This course will provide you with a solid foundation in GraphQL, allowing you to fully grasp its core principles and understand how it differs from traditional REST APIs.

Here are the sections in this course:

* What is GraphQL?
* Query Basics
* Making a GraphQL Server (with Apollo)
* Schema & Types
* Resolver Functions
* Query Variables
* Related Data
* Mutations (Adding & Deleting Data)
* Update Mutation

By the time you complete this course, you'll be equipped with the practical skills needed to design, implement, and optimize data-driven applications using GraphQL. The Net Ninja's engaging teaching style and step-by-step tutorials ensure that you'll be able to follow along and apply what you've learned immediately.
