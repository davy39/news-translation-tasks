On this week's episode of the podcast, I interview Jerod Santo, host of The Changelog, a podcast about open source software development that has been going strong for 15 years.

Jerod is plugged in to the world of Open Source, going to all the big conferences and interviewing all the big open source creators.

We have a fun, wide-reaching conversation about some of the current issues facing open source, such as AI models and Relicensing – essentially, a big company closed-sourcing a previously open source project after they buy out its creator. (Fun fact: this can't happen to freeCodeCamp because charities cannot be bought or sold.)

I ask Jerod about:

* his life as a remote dev in Omaha, Nebraska, raising his 6 his kids
    
* the Changelog News podcast with its weekly 10 minutes of updates on the world of open source
    
* his process, and how he researches and surfaces interesting news for his show
    
* and how The Changelog commissioned 3 full albums worth of music over the years, which you can stream for free.
    

Can you guess what bass line I'm playing during the intro? It's from a 1984 pop classic.
