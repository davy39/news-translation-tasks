I am happy to announce that the freeCodeCamp mobile app is finally ready for you to download. 🎊

The mobile development team just pushed a big update with many helpful improvements, including the much-awaited /learn user experience.

You can now code your way through the Responsive Web Design curriculum and save your progress – right on your phone. You can seamlessly shift your freeCodeCamp learning from your desktop to your phone at any time.

And we're working on implementing even more certifications, including our JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures certification.

The /learn experience features a built-in code editor specifically designed for easy coding on the go. You can also use it to build your certification projects.

Here's a sneak peek into the /learn experience on a mobile device:

It's also possible to preview your challenges and projects. This shows a preview of the Camper Café project:

Of course, there are so many more tutorials and features to explore in the mobile app. But we'll leave those for you to discover. 😉

We've also made some improvements to /news, Code Radio, and our Podcast listener – which are also available in the app.

## How can I download the app?

You can [visit the Play Store page](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.freecodecamp) and download the official freeCodeCamp app.

If you are not able to access the Google Play Store in your country, you can download the latest version of the .apk file directly [from GitHub](https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/mobile/releases/latest).

Many of the reviews of the app are of the old 2021 version, which was just a simple web app version that had lots of bugs. 

This new version is the result of thousands of hours of development by the freeCodeCamp engineering team. We are very proud of this powerful Flutter-based Android app.

So after you use it for a while, if you like it and find it to be helpful, be sure to leave a 5-star review. 😉

## How can I help the freeCodeCamp community beta test upcoming features?

Here's how to sign up for the open beta on Android. (We're working on getting the iOS version live soon, too.)

First, [visit the Google Play Store page](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.freecodecamp).

At the bottom of the page, there should be a message saying "Join the beta." Just click join, and the app page should show you an update button shortly afterward.

That's it – you are now officially in the beta program. 🧑‍💻

_You may see this message in the Google Play Store._

Do note that your progress will not yet be saved on freeCodeCamp's servers. It will only be stored locally on your device. This means that any progress you make will not count towards completing any projects on the freeCodeCamp website. But we're working hard to add this functionality ASAP.

Thank you to all the open source contributors who have helped develop the freeCodeCamp mobile app so far. We are just getting started.

If you are interested in contributing to the mobile app, you can learn a lot about Flutter development and User Experience while helping the community. I encourage you to [start your contribution journey with this guide](https://contribute.freecodecamp.org/#/how-to-setup-freecodecamp-mobile-app-locally).

Happy coding. 🙂
