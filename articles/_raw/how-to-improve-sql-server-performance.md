SQL server performance can be tricky. But there are a lot of things you can do to increase the speed of your queries.

We just published a course on the freeCodeCamp.org YouTube channel that will teach you how to improve performance on SQL Server.

Rajan Arora developed this course. Rajan is a very experienced developer and a great teacher.

In this course you will see how to diagnose what is happening with a slow running SQL statement and what strategies are available to make these statements run faster.

First, you will be shown how developers should use database indexes throughout their database, including what columns should be indexed and how to make sure a SQL statement will use an index.

Next, you'll go over how some built in diagnostic tools in SQL Server can help you find performance issues in your application, including how to identify the slowest running SQL in your application.

Then, you will see how to trace all of the SQL that your application is generating inside of SQL Server and how to understand this data.

Finally, you'll take a look at practices you can implement inside of your application to insure the best performance possible.

By the end of this course, you as an application developer will have the tools you need to troubleshoot performance problems you may encounter when using SQL Server.

Below are the sections in this course.
