Apache Cassandra is a NoSQL database used by some of the largest companies in the world, including Facebook, Netflix, eBay, and Twitter.

We just published a full course on Apache Cassandra on the freeCodeCamp.org YouTube channel.

Apache Cassandra is a free and open-source distributed NoSQL database management system designed to handle large amounts of data across many commodity servers, providing high availability with no single point of failure. Cassandra offers robust support for clusters spanning multiple datacenters, with asynchronous masterless replication allowing low latency operations for all clients.

A NoSQL database provides a mechanism for storage and retrieval of data that is modeled in means other than the tabular relations used in relational databases.

Here are some benefits of Apache Cassandra over a typical SQL database:

* Cassandra is designed to be scalable and can handle large amounts of data.
* Cassandra is a NoSQL database, which means it does not use the traditional table structure found in SQL databases. This can make Cassandra more flexible and easier to use for certain types of data.
* Cassandra is designed to be highly available, meaning it can continue to function even if some of its nodes fail.
* Cassandra is fast and can handle a high volume of reads and writes.

Watch the full Apache Cassandra course below or on the freeCodeCamp.org YouTube channel (1-hour watch).
