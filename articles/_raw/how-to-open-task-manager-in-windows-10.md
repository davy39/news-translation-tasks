Windows Task Manager is an advanced utility tool that helps you manage your apps that are running. 

Task Manager lets you see which apps are open and which you're using. You can also see which apps are running in the background that you didn't open yourself. 

One important reason that you might want to open Task Manager is to stop apps that are making windows unresponsive. 

There are a few different ways to open Task Manager. So in this article, I will walk you through 7 ways you can open Task Manager on Windows 10.

## 1. How to Open Task Manager with Windows Search 

The easiest way to find anything on a Windows machine is to search for it. Task Manager is not an exception. 

- Click on the search icon then type "Task Manager" in the search bar. 
- Task Manager will pop up as a search result, and you can open it from there.

## 2. How to Open Task Manager with Keyboard Shortcuts

Some apps might go rogue and stop Windows from responding, so you might not have access to Windows Search in such situations.

Windows has two different key combinations with which you can open up Task Manager in case you want to see running apps or stop an app.

- You can open Task Manager by pressing `Ctrl + Shift + Esc` all together. This opens Task Manager straightaway 
- You can also open Task Manager from the GINA screen by pressing and holding `Ctrl + Alt + Del`.

Some apps might prevent you from accessing Task Manager with Ctrl + Shift + Esc, but pressing `Ctrl + Alt + Del` will always open up the Graphical Identification and Authentication (GINA) screen for you so you can select and open Task Manager from there.
