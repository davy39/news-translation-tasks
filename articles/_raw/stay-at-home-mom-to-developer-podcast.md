This week I interview Phoebe Voong-Fadel about her childhood as the daughter of refugees, and how she self-studied coding and became a professional developer at the age of 36.

Phoebe worked from age 12 at her parent's Chinese take-out restaurant. She was able to study history at the London School of Economics, before working in higher ed.

She left her job to raise two kids due to the high cost of childcare in the UK. After two years of teaching herself to code using freeCodeCamp, she got her first job as a software developer.

I recorded this podcast live and I haven't edited it at all. I want to capture the feel of a real live conversation, with all the human quirks that entails. As with all my podcast episodes, I start by performing a classic bass line. Can you guess what song this bass line is from? It's from 1989.

Phoebe has earned multiple certifications from freeCodeCamp, and also published a number of articles on our publication.

How Phoebe went from stay-at-home mom to Front End Web Developer at age 36
