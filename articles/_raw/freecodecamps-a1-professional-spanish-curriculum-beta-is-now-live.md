The freeCodeCamp community just published the first three chapters of our new A1 Professional Spanish Curriculum. Each chapter includes hundreds of interactive tasks designed to help you take your first steps in learning Spanish with confidence.

## How Does the New A1 Professional Spanish Curriculum Work?

In this A1 Professional Spanish Curriculum, you'll learn the building blocks of the Spanish language. It follows the A1 level of the Common European Framework of Reference (CEFR). And we've focused on vocabulary that is particularly useful for professional settings.

The curriculum is broken down into several modules that include warm-up, learning, practice, review pages, and quizzes to make sure that you truly understand the material before moving onto the next module.

The **warm-up** serves as preparation and provides context for the main content of the module.

The tasks in the warm-up will either introduce you to new vocabulary for the first time, or review content you have already learned that will be used in the current module.

Below is an example of what you will find in the lessons:

Each task will have an accompanying question that will help you practice the content. If you don’t know how to answer a question or need more details, you can check the explanation section below the question.

After the **warm-up**, you’ll head over to **Learn**. This is where you’ll see the new words you’ve learned in action! You'll listen to short sections of monologues or dialogues and answer questions about them to make sure you understand their meaning and how they're used in real conversations. This is also where you’ll learn some theory when needed.

The curriculum also has fill-in-the-blank questions that will help you practice writing in Spanish.

After **Learn**, you’ll move on to **Practice** where you'll complete more open-ended tasks that test your comprehension and your ability to write in Spanish.

At the end of each module, there is a **Review** section with grammar highlights and a glossary of the main points and concepts covered. You can use these review pages to help you study for the quizzes.

The last portion of the module is the **Quiz**. Quizzes are designed to test your understanding from the material covered in the module.

Throughout the certification, each chapter will have these quizzes. You’ll need to complete them in order to qualify for the exam at the end of the certification.

The certification exam will be the final item released for this certification. We are currently publishing the first three chapters, and future chapters will be released progressively as they are developed by our instructional design team. Once all the chapters are available, we will release the certification exam.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Is all of this really free?

Yes. freeCodeCamp has always been free, and we’ve now offered free verified certifications for more than a decade.

### Can I study the Spanish curriculum in languages other than English?

We aim to make every course available in all supported languages on freeCodeCamp. Check your account settings to see if the course you are studying is already offered in your preferred language.

### What language skills does the Spanish curriculum cover?

The languages courses currently cover listening, reading, and writing. We have plans to add speaking later on.

### Are the audio in the language courses and exams recorded by native language speakers?

Yes. All the audio lessons present in the language courses were recorded by native speakers of that language.

### I am Deaf or hard of hearing. Can I still study the language courses?

Yes! All audio lesson have closed captions and transcripts available for reading.

### I am blind or have limited vision, and use a screen reader. Can I still take the language courses?

### What are the letters and numbers after the curriculum name? (For example: A1, A2, B1)

These labels refer to the CEFR levels, which is an international framework used to describe language proficiency. A1 and A2 represent beginner levels, B1 and B2 represent intermediate levels, and C1 and C2 represent advanced levels. Each level indicates the skills and knowledge you are expected to have at that stage of your language learning journey.

![Graphic titled “CEFR Levels Explained” showing the six CEFR language proficiency levels from A1 to C2. A1 is described as communicating with help from the listener. A2 involves communicating in a limited range of contexts. B1 focuses on communicating essential points in familiar contexts. B2 involves communicating with some fluency in a range of contexts. C1 emphasizes flexible and fluent communication in many contexts. C2 represents precise and sensitive communication in most contexts.
