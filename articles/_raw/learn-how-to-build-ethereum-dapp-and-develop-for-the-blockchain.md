* Remix, the online IDE for Solidity
* Truffle, the framework for Solidity smart contracts
* Ganache, the local development Blockchain
* Web3, the JS library to integrate a Dapp frontend
* Metamask, the Ethereum wallet used by most Dapps (browser extension)
* Deployment to public testnet (Ropsten) and mainnet, using Infura API
