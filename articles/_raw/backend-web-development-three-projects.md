To become a great backend developer, you need to build a lot of projects. We just posted a course on the freeCodeCamp.org YouTube channel that will help you improve your backend development skills by teaching you to build three full projects.

Tomi Tokko developed this course. He's a popular teacher, and despite his young age has taught many courses over the past 4 years.

This course not only enhances your backend development skills but also gives you a taste of combining frontend technologies to create full-fledged applications.

Tomi offers an engaging and detailed course that guides you through building three projects.

Here are the projects you will build:

1. **AI Blog Article Generator**: Dive into the world of artificial intelligence as you create a tool that generates blog articles. You will learn about the integration of AI in web development.
2. **Netflix Clone**: Build a clone of Netflix, where you'll implement user authentication, video streaming, and a dynamic, responsive user interface.
3. **Spotify Clone**: Create a music streaming platform, learning how to manage audio files, user playlists, and real-time data streaming.

And here are the technologies you will use:

* **Python**: Known for its readability and efficiency, Python is a favorite among backend developers. You'll use Python to build robust backend logic and handle server-side operations.
* **Django**: This high-level Python web framework encourages rapid development and clean, pragmatic design. With Django, you'll structure your backend, manage databases, and ensure your applications are secure and scalable.
* **JavaScript**: While primarily known for frontend development, JavaScript's role in this course is to add interactivity and enhance the user experience of your applications.
* **PostgreSQL**: This powerful, open-source object-relational database system offers reliability, feature robustness, and performance. You'll use PostgreSQL to manage and query your application data efficiently.
* **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework, Tailwind CSS enables you to style your applications without leaving your HTML. It's a powerful tool for designing responsive and visually appealing user interfaces.

Whether you're new to backend development or looking to expand your skill set, this course offers a structured and detailed path to mastering essential technologies and concepts. Watch the full course on [the freeCodeCamp.org YouTube channel](https://youtu.be/ftKiHCDVwfA) (10-hour watch).
