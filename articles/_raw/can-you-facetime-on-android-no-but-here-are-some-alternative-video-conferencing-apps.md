FaceTime is one of the most popular communication apps for Apple users. If you have a MacBook, iPad or iPhone, then the application has already been installed on your device. You start the app, enter your username and password, then start using it. Perfect.

But FaceTime is only available for Apple/iOS users. It doesn’t exist in the Android store. So if  you switch to an Android device or already using it, then you are not able to use FaceTime.

So in this article, I will introduce some of the FaceTime alternatives on the market that you can use in your Android device. These are all free and have millions of downloads.

## 1. Whatsapp Messenger

**Price:** Free
