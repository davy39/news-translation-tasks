Next.js is a popular framework for building server-rendered JavaScript applications.

We just published a full course on the freeCodeCamp.org YouTube channel that will help you learn how to use Next.js.

Next.js is built on top of React, which is a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. Next.js makes it easy to create efficient and scalable web applications, and it also includes features such as automatic code splitting and optimized performance out of the box. It is often used for building server-rendered React applications, and it is a popular choice among developers who want to build performant and scalable web applications quickly and easily.

In this Next.js course for beginners by Alicia Rodriguez, you will learn how to build a full-stack App from scratch. You will also learn how to deploy the app using Vercel and to sync up GitHub with Vercel so we deploy the app automatically.

Here are the sections in this course:

* What is Next.js?
* Main Feature: Server-Side Rendering 
* Create a new Next.js Project 
* Analyse the Final App You Will Build
* Next.js Files Structure 
* Next.js Pages & Build the pages 
* Data Fetching 
* Build the Components - UI (user Interface) 
* Add CSS - Styles   
* API Routing in Next.js 
* Deploy the APP in Vercel 
* Suggestions to Improve the App 

Watch the full course on the freeCodeCamp.org YouTube channel (5-hour watch).
