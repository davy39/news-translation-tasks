We're excited to announce the launch of a new course on the freeCodeCamp.org YouTube channel that will give you an in-depth understanding of how to build a custom API using Next.js and MongoDB.

This course was created by Hitesh Choudhary. He is an an expert in the field and has extensive experience in developing, teaching, and sharing his knowledge in an engaging and easy-to-understand manner.

### About the Course

This course will provide a comprehensive guide on building an authentication system that can register the user, login, create a secure cookie with a JWT Token, use email service, verify the user's email, forget password, middleware route protection, and much more. It's a project-based course where you learn by doing, and by the end of it, you'll have a fully functioning authentication system built from scratch.

The course further explores how to integrate Appwrite, a secure end-to-end backend server for Web, Mobile, and Flutter developers that makes it easy to build web and mobile applications, into your Next.js application.

Deployment is a crucial part of any application's lifecycle, and Hitesh makes sure not to skip that part. You will learn about deploying your Next.js application to Vercel, a cloud platform for static sites and Serverless Functions that fits perfectly with your workflow. It enables developers to host Jamstack websites and web services that deploy instantly.

**Signup and Login**: In this section, you'll start getting your hands dirty by implementing the Signup and Login functionality for your application.

**Middleware in Nextjs**: Middleware is an important concept in Next.js, and you'll learn how to use it for route protection and much more.

**User Verification with Email**: User verification is an essential part of any authentication system. Hitesh shows you how to implement it using an email service.

**Nextjs Deployment with Database Connectivity**: You will learn how to deploy your Next.js application while maintaining the database connectivity.

**Nextjs Meets Appwrite**: Introduction to Appwrite, its features, and how it can be integrated with your Next.js application.

**How to Integrate Appwrite to Nextjs**: A step-by-step guide to integrate Appwrite into your Next.js application.

**Nextjs Component to Talk to Appwrite**: Creating a Next.js component that can communicate with Appwrite.

**Appwrite Nextjs and Context API**: Learn about using Context API in Next.js and how it can be used with Appwrite.

**What’s Next After This**: Once you've built your application, Hitesh guides you on the next steps you can take to further improve your skills and the application you just built.
