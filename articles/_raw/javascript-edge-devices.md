Smart devices today are very similar to labour-saving gadgets a generation ago: Where previously everything got a power cord, now everything gets a chip. 

Thanks to modern solutions and hardware like the Raspberry Pi and solutions like Resin.io removing the difficult and expensive parts of creating physical devices, this is no longer the purvue of specialized embedded developers, and allows anyone who can code in Javascript or pretty much every other language to become part of this massive new wave of innovation.

Learn about how to use JavaScript in edge devices in this talk by Cameron Diver at the JS Monthly London July meetup.

You can watch the full video on [the freeCodeCamp.org YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2e5p7LT3eaE) (20 minute watch).‌
