It is estimated that there are 24 million eCommerce websites on the internet. Do you want to learn how to make one more?

We just published a course on the freeCodeCamp.org YouTube channel that will teach you how to create an e-commerce website using Django and Vue. 

This course was developed by CodeWithStein. He has created many great tutorials on his YouTube channel and we wanted to bring him to a wider audience.

To watch this course, it would be helpful to have at least some knowledge of both Python and JavaScript since Django uses Python and Vue uses JavaScript.

In the course, you'll use the Django Rest Framework to build the API and backend and Vue to create a separate frontend. You'll implement payments with Stripe.

Here are the sections covered in this course:

* Install and setup (Django)
* Install and setup (Vue)
* Include Font Awesome
* How to set up the base template
* How to create the Django app and models for products
* How to create the serializer and views for the products
* How to create a simple front page (latest products)
* How to view a product 
* How to set up Vuex / State
* How to make it possible to add to cart
* How to implement a loading bar
* How to set the document title (All pages)
* How to make it possible to view a category
* How to add search functionality
* How to view cart
* How to change the contents of the cart (Increment/Decrement content, Remove from cart)
* How to enable sign up
* How to enable log in
* How to create a simple my account page
* How to proceed to checkout (Authentication)
* How to create a simple success page
* How to show my orders on the my account page
* How to deploy Django 
* How to deploy Vue (Generate files locally, Send files to server, Set up NGINX virtual host)
