Understanding algorithms in an important skill for many computer science jobs. Algorithms help us solve problems efficiently.

We just published an introduction to algorithms with Python course on the freeCodeCamp.org YouTube channel.

In this course, you'll work with algorithm basics like recursion then go all the way to working with concepts like dynamic programming.

Joy Brock developed this course. Joy is an experienced teacher with an amazing talent for breaking down complex topics using humor and visualizations.

While the course is incredibly fun and fast-paced, it doesn't make any assumptions about your previous experience with algorithms. This course is ideal for new software developers, aspiring machine learning engineers, those looking for "pre-FAANG" prep, and students who've had difficulty understanding algorithms in the past.

Here are the sections covered in this course:

* Intro & course overview 
* Factorials refresher
* CODING CHALLENGE: Factorial program using iteration, recursion
* What is a permutation?
* CODING CHALLENGE: Recursive permutation
* Iterative permutation example
* 8/N queens problem: theory & explanation
* Real world example of permutations
* Lesson recap
* What are data structures?
* What is a one-dimensional array?
