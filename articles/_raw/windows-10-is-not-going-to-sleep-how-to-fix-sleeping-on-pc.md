If you stop working temporarily and you're not ready to shut down your PC, Windows 10 sleep mode is a great option. 

It turns off your computer's monitor and hard drive, slowing down power consumption in the process.

But your PC might refuse to go to sleep sometimes. This could be due to **peripheral devices** and **errors in power settings**.

If you're currently unable to put your computer to sleep, you've come to the right place. 

In this article, I will show you 4 ways you make your computer go to sleep again so it consumes less power.

## How to Fix Windows 10 PC Not Going to Sleep By Removing Peripheral Devices

Peripheral Devices such as your mouse, keyboard, scanner, and network adapters can interfere with your PC power settings and prevent it from going to sleep.

I've been in this situation before, and I've seen people around me in the same situation. But I won't advise you disable these devices from being able to wake up your computer. 

The best thing you can do is remove these devices whenever you want to put your PC to sleep, then plug them back in when you are ready to work again.

## How to Fix Windows 10 PC Not Going to Sleep By Disabling Screensaver

Screensavers can interfere with the sleep timers you set. So an active screensaver can prevent your computer from going to sleep.

You can disable screensavers with the steps below:

**Step 1**: Click on Start and search for "change screensaver". Then select the "Change screensaver" search result.

## How to Fix Windows 10 PC Not Going to Sleep By Disabling Hybrid Mode

Hybrid mode is the combination of Sleep and Hibernation. It hibernates your computer but gives you the restoration speed of sleep mode.

If hybrid mode is turned on, it could stop your PC from going to sleep. 

To disable hybrid mode, follow these steps:

**Step 1**: Click on Start and select Settings.
