> Alone, we can do so little; together, we can do so much.
Helen Keller

It’s true – when you lend someone a helping hand, you feel a lot better about yourself, and you will likely learn something new. 

Helping others feels so rewarding because you know that you have contributed something very important to humanity. And what better way to help your fellow developers than to join one of the many developer communities out there?

## What are Developer Communities?

Over the past few years lots of developer communities have come together with different goals and missions. But you'll probably agree with me that they all have several things in common:

* They help you learn,
* They share ideas
* They offer support to newbies, and
* You can freely interact with them and within them.  

There are many different types of developer communities out there – front-end focused, back-end focused, and specific language-based. We also have general communities which include all of the above under one platform.  

### What are the benefits of developer communities?

The benefits offered by these communities are 'on another level' as I would say. They have helped people start from scratch and eventually land jobs in big tech companies like Google and Microsoft. They have also developed mentors and have helped improve their code writing and reviewing skills.

In other words, being part of a developer community can really help you learn how to code.

## How Do You Pick a Developer Community to Join?

I want to help those of you who are looking for a good community to join according to your interests and skills. So I've gathered a few of the top communities that focus on the front-end, back-end, blogging, and more to help you get started and meet your fellow developers. 

I may have not included all the communities out there because we have a ton of them. So feel free to message me with any others that you feel are really helpful and important.
