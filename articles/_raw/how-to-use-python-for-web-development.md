Python is a popular programming language that is widely used in the development of web applications. It is easy to learn, has a large and active community, and is supported by a wealth of libraries and frameworks.

We just published a crash course on the freeCodeCamp.org YouTube channel that will teach you the basics of using Python for web development. Through a series of short projects, you will learn about a variety of important concepts related to web development.

Tomi Tokko developed this course. Tomi is a popular course creator and freeCodeCamp.org team member.

Our course is structured to cover a range of topics, starting with the basics and gradually building up to more advanced concepts. We'll begin by covering SQL in Python, which will allow you to interact with databases and store and retrieve data. Next, we'll delve into APIs in Python, showing you how to access and work with data from other sources.

We'll also be covering classes and objects in Python, which are fundamental concepts in object-oriented programming. You'll learn how to create and use classes and objects in your web development projects, and how they can help you organize and structure your code.

Another important topic that we'll be covering is web scraping in Python. You'll learn how to use Python to extract data from websites and how to manipulate that data for your own purposes. We'll also be covering virtual environments, which are essential for isolating different projects and their dependencies.

Finally, we'll be covering two popular Python web frameworks: Flask and Django. We'll show you how to set up and use these frameworks, and we'll even build a simple calculator app using Django.

Whether you're a beginner looking to get started in web development or an experienced developer looking to add Python to your toolkit, this course has something for you.
