We just published a full beginner's course on the freeCodeCamp.org YouTube channel that will teach you the fundamentals of Mandarin Chinese.

This course is designed to guide you to the HSK 1 level. The Hanyu Shuiping Kaoshi (HSK) is China's official standardized test of Chinese language proficiency for non-native speakers. HSK Level 1 is the first step on your journey and certifies that you can understand and use very simple Chinese phrases and meet basic communication needs.

Whether you're planning a trip, connecting with friends, exploring new career opportunities, or simply love learning languages, this course is a great starting point. LangAdvance developed this course.

Here is what is covered:

* **Pinyin and Tones:** Master the official romanization system for Chinese characters and the four tones that determine a word's meaning.
    
* **Essential Vocabulary:** Learn the 150 core words required for the HSK 1 exam, covering topics like greetings, family, time, food, and hobbies.
    
* **Basic Grammar:** Understand fundamental sentence structures, how to ask questions, and use common grammatical particles.
    
* **Practical Conversation:** Build confidence to handle real-world situations like introducing yourself, ordering a coffee, asking for the date, and talking about your family.
    
* **Character Recognition:** Get an introduction to reading and writing the most common Chinese characters.
    

This course requires no prior knowledge of Mandarin and is structured to build your skills logically from the ground up.

Start your journey to learning one of the world's most influential languages today!
