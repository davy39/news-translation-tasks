About one out of every 200 software developers is blind. We know this because Stack Overflow [asked 64,000 developers about this a few months ago](https://fcc.im/2qp6ddh).

The question is: how can blind developers code when they can’t see the screen?

freeCodeCamp contributor [Florian Beijers](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-blind-people-code-fdb64e3bf5c/undefined) was born blind. He’s able to code using a standard-issue laptop. He uses a piece of software called a **screen reader**. With it, he can select a line of text or code, and hear its contents read back to him at hundreds of words per minute. He wrote an article explaining how he’s [able to code while blind](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/a-vision-of-coding/).

> “How I code doesn’t actually differ all that much from how [sighted developers] code. I’ve learned how to touch type, and mentally conceptualize my code so that I can work with it just like you guys do. The only difference is that I barely ever use a mouse for anything. I tend to stick with hotkeys and the command line instead.” — Florian Beijers

This is just one of the many developers out there who have figured out ways to code productively despite blindness. I hope this inspires you to keep coding despite whatever setbacks you face, and to encourage other people to do the same.
