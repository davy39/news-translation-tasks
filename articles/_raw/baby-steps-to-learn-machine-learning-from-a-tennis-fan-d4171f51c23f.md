One year back, I was a newbie to the world of Machine Learning. I used to get overwhelmed by small decisions, like choosing the language to code with, choosing the right online courses, or choosing the correct algorithms.

So, I have planned to make it easier for folks to get into Machine Learning.

I’ll assume that many of us are starting from scratch on our Machine Learning journey. Let’s find out how current professionals in the field reached their destination, and how we can emulate them on our journey.

I will illustrate how you can learn Data Science by drawing a parallel between how Rafael Nadal learned to play tennis, and how you can learn Machine Learning.

### Commit Yourself — Stage 1

_Rafael Nadal at age 3_

Nadal had sports talent all around him in his family. Inspired by them, he began his tennis journey at the age of 3.

For anyone starting out in Machine Learning, it’s important to surround yourselves with people who are also learning, teaching and practicing Machine Learning.

Learning the ropes is not easy if you do it alone. So, commit yourselves to learning Machine Learning — and find data science communities to help make your entry less painful.

### **Learn the Ecosystem — Stage 2**

_Rafael Nadal practices tennis_

Rafael Nadal learnt the not only the rules of Tennis, but also the surrounding ‘ecosystem’.

He learnt about the different types of rackets, balls, court surfaces. He learned about the scoring in tennis. He enrolled himself for a tennis coaching.

#### Discover the Machine Learning ecosystem

Data Science is a field which has embraced and made full use of open source platforms. While data analysis can be conducted in a number of languages, using the right tools can make or break projects.

Data Science libraries are flourishing in the **Python** and **R** ecosystems. See [here for an infographic](https://www.datacamp.com/community/tutorials/r-or-python-for-data-analysis) on Python vs R for data analysis.

Whichever language you choose, **Jupyter** **Notebook** and **RStudio** makes our life much easier. They allow us to visualize data while manipulating it. Follow [this link to read more](http://blog.kaggle.com/2015/12/07/three-things-i-love-about-jupyter-notebooks/) on the features of Jupyter Notebook.

**Kaggle, Analytics Vidhya, MachineLearningMastery and KD Nuggets** are some of the active communityies where data scientists all over the world enrich each other’s learning.

Machine Learning has been democratized by online courses or MOOCs from **Coursera**, **EdX** and others, where we learn from amazing professors at world class universities. Here’s a [list of the top MOOCs](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/i-ranked-all-the-best-data-science-intro-courses-based-on-thousands-of-data-points-db5dc7e3eb8e) on data science available right now.

### Cement the Foundation — Stage 3

#### Rafael Nadal learned the basic shots

Nadal’s coach taught him the forehand and backhand shots. This is the main foundation of tennis. Rafael could play the match competently with these basic shots.

#### Learn to manipulate data

> _Data scientists, according to interviews and expert estimates, spend 50 percent to 80 percent of their time mired in the mundane labor of collecting and preparing unruly digital data, before it can be explored for useful nuggets. - Steve Lohr of New York Times_

‘Data Crunching’ is the soul of the whole Machine Learning workflow. To help with this process, the [**Pandas**](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/) library in python or R’s DataFrames allow you to manipulate and conduct analysis. They provide data structures for relational or labeled data.

Data science is more than just building machine learning models. It’s also about explaining the models and using them to drive data-driven decisions. In the journey from analysis to data-driven outcomes, data visualization plays a very important role of presenting data in a powerful and credible way.

[**Matplotlib**](http://matplotlib.org) library in Python or [**ggplot**](http://ggplot2.org) in R offer complete 2D graphic support with very high flexibility to create high quality data visualizations.

These are some of the libraries you will be spending most of your time on when conducting the analysis.

### Practice day in and day out — Stage 4

Rafael Nadal, when asked how much he trained:

> “I train four hours a day, 210 days a year. If we add to that I play around 80 matches per year, each one lasting an average of two hours. That is 1000 hours playing tennis per year — and that is without counting the training days during tournaments.”

#### **Learn Machine Learning algorithms and practice them**

After the foundation is set, you get to implement the Machine Learning algorithms to predict and do all the cool stuff.

The [**Scikit-learn**](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/) library in Python or the [**caret**](https://cran.r-project.org/package=caret), [**e1071**](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/e1071/index.html) libraries in R provide a range of supervised and unsupervised learning algorithms via a consistent interface.

These let you implement an algorithm without worrying about the inner workings or nitty-gritty details.

Apply these machine learning algorithms in the use cases you find all around you. This could either be in your work, or you can practice in **Kaggle** competitions. In these, data scientists all around the world compete at building models to solve problems.

Simultaneously, understand the inner workings of one algorithm after another. Starting with ‘Hello World!’ of Machine Learning, **Linear Regression** then move to **Logistic Regression**, **Decision Trees** to **Support Vector Machines**. This will require you to brush up your statistics and linear algebra.

Coursera Founder Andrew Ng, a pioneer in AI has developed a [Machine Learning course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning) which gives you a good starting point to understanding inner workings of Machine Learning algorithms.

### **Learn the advanced skills— Stage 5**

#### Rafael Nadal learned to play advanced shots

Nadal, while concentrating on the fundamental play, also was introduced to the advanced shots. The shots that only professionals who play tennis day in and day out are able to pull off.

#### Learn complex Machine Learning Algorithms and Deep Learning architectures

While Machine Learning as a field was established long back, the recent hype and media attention is primarily due to Machine Learning applications in AI fields like Computer Vision, Speech Recognition, Language Processing. Many of these have been pioneered by the tech giants like Google, Facebook, Microsoft.

These recent advances can be credited to the progress made in cheap computation, the availability of large scale data, and the development of novel Deep Learning architectures.

To work in Deep Learning, you will need to learn how to process unstructured data — be it free text, images, or sounds.

You will learn to use platforms like **TensorFlow** or **Torch**, which lets us apply Deep Learning without worrying about low level hardware requirements. You will learn Reinforcement learning, which has made possible modern AI wonders like [**AlphaGo Zero**](https://deepmind.com/blog/alphago-zero-learning-scratch/).
