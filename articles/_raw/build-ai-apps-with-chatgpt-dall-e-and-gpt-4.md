You can level up your web development skills by harnessing the power of AI.

We just published a course on the freeCodeCamp.org YouTube channel that will teach you how to build AI apps with ChatGPT, Dall-E, and GPT-4. This course is designed to equip you with the knowledge and skills to create cutting-edge AI-powered applications.

In this course, you will build three projects utilizing the OpenAI API and explore the capabilities of ChatGPT, Dall-E, and the revolutionary GPT-4 model. Get ready to build a movie pitch generator, an ask-me-anything chatbot, and a fine-tuned bot trained on your very own dataset.

Let's delve into what you'll learn in this course:

1. Building fetch requests for the OpenAI API
2. Exploring OpenAI's models and tools
3. Mastering the Create Completions endpoint
4. Harnessing the power of prompt engineering
5. Unleashing the 'zero shot' and 'few shot' approaches
6. Understanding the temperature property for creative output
7. Utilizing the Create Image endpoint with Dall-E
8. Building chatbots with ChatGPT
9. Exploring chatbot-specific prompt syntax
10. Navigating the Create Chat Completions endpoint
11. Fine-tuning your chatbot for personalized responses
12. Utilizing Firebase to persist chatbot conversations
13. Deploying your AI app securely with hidden API keys

Let's take a closer look at the projects you'll be building throughout the course:

**MoviePitch**: Transform a one-sentence idea into a full-fledged movie synopsis with a captivating title, a star-studded cast, and mesmerizing cover art. Experience the power of AI in generating compelling ideas and images.

**KnowItAll Chatbot**: Dive into the realm of GPT-4 and construct an ask-me-anything chatbot. Discover the capabilities of this mind-blowing model for natural language generation and handling general Q&A tasks.

**We-Wingit Drone Deliveries Chatbot**: Fine-tune your chatbot to provide precise answers based on your custom dataset. Gain the crucial skill of training AI models to cater to specific domains, making your chatbot or any AI app more focused and relevant.

Before diving into this course, it is recommended that you have a basic understanding of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. With these foundations in place, you'll be well-prepared to embark on this exciting AI journey.

Your instructor for this course is Tom Chant, a tutor at Scrimba with a wealth of experience in web development. Tom's goal is to make learning to code a pain-free and enjoyable experience, and he'll guide you through each step of this transformative course.

With the OpenAI API, you can finally incorporate AI features into your own applications. This course provides hands-on experience, empowering you to build projects that leverage the full potential of artificial intelligence.

Additionally, you'll learn how to store conversations using Firebase, a powerful real-time database, and how to reference information from previous interactions. You'll also explore using Netlify serverless functions to hide your API key, an essential skill for securing your APIs in portfolio projects and live sites.
