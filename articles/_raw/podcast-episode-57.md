On this week's episode of the freeCodeCamp podcast, Quincy interviews Adam Hollett. He's a software developer at Shopify in Ottawa, Canada.

Adam started building basic websites and forums when he was in high school, but he never saw coding as something he could do professionally. He got a degree in English Literature, worked in food prep, and taught at a community college. He later worked as a technical writer, and set his eyes on working at Shopify, a major Canadian tech company based in Ottawa. Adam was able to gradually to learn new tools on the job that helped him transition into a role as developer.

We talk about Adam's journey - from meandering college student to software developer - and the many lessons he learned along the way.
