What is a .csv file? CSV stands for Comma Separated Values. A CSV file is a plain text file that stores tables and spreadsheet information. The contents are often a table of text, numbers, or dates. CSV files can be easily imported and exported using programs that store data in tables.

## CSV File Format

Usually the first line in a CSV file contains the table column labels. Each of the subsequent lines represent a row of the table. Commas separate each cell in the row, which is where the name comes from.

Here is an example of a CSV file. The example has three columns, labeled 'name', 'id', and 'food'. It has five rows including the header row.

```
name, id, favorite food
quincy, 1, hot dogs
beau, 2, cereal
abbey, 3, pizza
mrugesh, 4, ice cream
```

Here is how that file looks in a spreadsheet.

Since a CSV file is just a text file, you can create one in almost any text editor. You can also export CSV files from almost any spreadsheet program, such as [Microsoft Word](https://products.office.com/en-us/excel), [OpenOffice Calc](https://www.openoffice.org/product/calc.html), or [Google Sheets](https://sheets.google.com).

## How to open a CSV file

Opening a CSV file is simpler than you may think. In almost any text editor or spreadsheet program, just choose **File > Open** and select the CSV file.

For most people, it is best to use a spreadsheet program. Spreadsheet programs display the data in a way that is easier to read and work with than a text editor. We'll go into more detail on opening a CSV file in [Microsoft Excel](https://products.office.com/en-us/excel), [OpenOffice Calc](https://www.openoffice.org/product/calc.html), and [Google Sheets](https://sheets.google.com).

### Open a CSV file Microsoft Excel

If you already have Microsoft Excel installed, just double-click a CSV file to open it in Excel. After double-clicking the file, you may see a prompt asking which program you want to open it with. Select Microsoft Excel.

If you are already in Microsoft Excel, you can choose **File > Open** and select the CSV file. If you don't see the file you want to open, you may need to change the file type to be opened to "Text Files (*.prn, *.txt, *.csv)". Excel will display the data in a new workbook.

You can also import data from a CSV file into an existing worksheet.

1. On the **Data** tab, in the **Get & Transform Data** group, click **From Text/CSV**.
2. In the **Import Data** dialog box, double-click the CSV file you want to import, and click **Import**.

In the preview dialog box, you have a few options:

* Select **Load** if you want to load the data directly to a new worksheet.
* Select **Load to** if you want to load the data to a table or existing worksheet. 
* Select **Transform Data** if you want to load the data to Power Query, and edit it before bringing it to Excel.

### Open a CSV file OpenOffice Calc

If you already have OpenOffice Calc installed, just double-click a CSV file to open it. After double-clicking the file, you may see a prompt asking which program you want to open it with. Select OpenOffice Calc.

If you are already in OpenOffice Calc, you can choose **File > Open** and select the CSV file.

### Open a CSV file Google Sheets

First, open a new spreadsheet file in Google Sheets. The fastest way is to go to [https://sheets.new](https://sheets.new).

Next, select **File > Import**.

You can probably keep the default values on the **Import file** window, but look over them just to make sure. Then select **Import data**.
