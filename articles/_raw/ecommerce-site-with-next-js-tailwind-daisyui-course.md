When learning how to build a web app it can be helpful to see how everything works together, instead of learning a lot of technologies individually.

We just posted a course on the freeCodeCamp.org YouTube channel that will teach you how to build and deploy a full-stack e-commerce website with Next.js 13.4 and a bunch of other important technologies. Florian Walther from Coding in Flow. He is an experienced developer and has created many popular courses. 

In this course, you will learn:

* How to use Next.js server actions and call them from both server components and client components.
* How to run database operations & transactions with Prisma and how to use Prisma client extensions to hook into your queries.
* How to build a fully functional e-commerce website similar to Amazon.com.
* How to add authentication with Next-Auth, the Prisma adapter, MongoDB, and Google login.
* How to implement anonymous shopping carts for unauthenticated users and store the identifier in a cookie.
* How to build an amazing UI using TailwindCSS and DaisyUI.
* How to deploy your project to Vercel and set up the metadata for each page (including generateMetadata).
* How to deduplicate Prisma requests using the React cache function.
* How to set up tools like Prettier, Eslint, and the Prisma and TailwindCSS VS Code extensions to make your project easy to work with.

You will gain a comprehensive knowledge on how to combine a bunch of different technologies to perform every step needed to build and deploy a web app. You can use the skills you learn in this course in your own projects.

Here are the sections in this course:

* Project setup
* Prisma + MongoDB setup
