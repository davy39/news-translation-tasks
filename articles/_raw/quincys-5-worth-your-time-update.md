I've been sending my "5 freeCodeCamp resources worth your time" for 8 years now. That's nearly 400 emails that I've authored and sent out over the years.

Don't worry. I'm not tired. I love doing this, I'm going to keep working hard to share helpful learning resources with you.

I just need to make sure you're actually reading these emails. [Please fill out this Google form real quick. It will take less than 1 minute.](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfwh2v6SoldZiFOE8yE_r7OqbJmBjH6i2Z9PiFhZfrV8k48vg/viewform?usp=sf_link)

### Why I'm asking people to re-subscribe

Each week I send this email to all 7 million people who have opted in to receive it. This isn't cheap. Even with the cheapest email service on Earth (Amazon's Simple Email Service) it still costs our charity about $700 each week.

Now – I don't know exactly how many people open these emails. (Out of respect for your privacy, I refuse to add a tracking pixel or analytics to my emails, and instead send them in plain text.) But I suspect not all 7 million of you actually open them. 🙂

Again, if you want to keep getting these emails from me each week, [please fill out this Google form real quick. It will take less than 1 minute.](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfwh2v6SoldZiFOE8yE_r7OqbJmBjH6i2Z9PiFhZfrV8k48vg/viewform?usp=sf_link)

Thanks, and happy coding! 🏕️
