When FaceTime came out in 2010, it became a popular way for friends and family to connect over live video. But when FaceTime is not working, it can be a frustrating experience. 

In this article, I will provide some reasons why FaceTime might not be working and tips on how to fix it. 

## Your Apple device needs a restart

Restarting your device is usually a good first step to resolving a technical issue. People joke about it, but sometimes turning it off and on again really does work.

Close out of your open applications and try resetting the device to see if that resolves your FaceTime issues. 

## Issues with Date and Time

Most users will have their Date and Time set automatically on the device. But if you are experiencing issues with FaceTime, it might be that you have Date and Time set to manual.

Go to Settings (System Preferences on computers) and then go to Date and Time to check that Set Automatically is not turned off. 

## Apple services is down

Sometimes FaceTime might not be working because Apple services is down. You can check the [Apple System Service page](https://www.apple.com/support/systemstatus/) to see if FaceTime is experiencing technical difficulties. 

## FaceTime is not available in your country

FaceTime is available in many countries around the world but it is not available in all countries. 

You can visit the [Apple Support page](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204039) to check on wireless carriers that are available in your area. 

## Poor internet connection

If you are experiencing issues with your internet connection, that can affect the FaceTime application. You could look into fixing your internet connectivity issues or you can use your cellular data to use the FaceTime app. 

## Problems with group chats

There can be a few reasons why you are experiencing issues with group FaceTime chats. 

One reason might be that there is an issue on your end where you are unable to use chat. If that is the case, then go through the previous suggestions mentioned in the article.

Another reason might be that there is a problem with one or more individuals with their technical setups. I would let them know you are having trouble hearing or seeing them and they can look into their setups. 

If you are unsure where the issue is, then start off with one-on-one chats then gradually add more people. That will help you isolate the problem. 

## FaceTime is not up to date

If you are not keeping up with your software updates then that can negatively affect the performance of your applications. If you are experiencing issues with FaceTime, it is possible you will need to update your app. 

You will need to go to Settings, (System Preferences on computers) and then choose Software Update to make sure you are running on the most up to date software. 

## Try logging out of FaceTime

Sometimes the issue is as simple as logging out of FaceTime and then logging back in. You will need to go into your Settings, (System Preferences on computers)  and log out of your Apple ID for FaceTime, and then log back in. 

## Camera and/or microphone is not working

If you are having issues with your camera or microphone then try to test it out independently of FaceTime. 

On Mac computers you can test out your camera with PhotoBooth. On mobile or tablets, you can open the camera app and record a short video.

If your camera or microphone is still not working then I would suggest contacting [apple support](https://support.apple.com/). 

## FaceTime is turned off in Content & Privacy Restrictions

It is possible that your FaceTime is not working because it is turned off in the Content and Privacy section of your device. 

For phones and tablets, you will need go to Settings (System Preferences on computers) and then Content & Privacy Restrictions to make sure FaceTime is switched on. 

## Firewall is blocking access to FaceTime

It is possible that you have certain firewalls on your device that are blocking you from using FaceTime. Please visit the [Apple Support page](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202078), to learn about how to unblock those firewalls so you can use FaceTime. 

If you have tried all of the suggestions and it is still not working then I would suggest contacting [apple support](https://support.apple.com/).
