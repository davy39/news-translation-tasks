Micro-frontends let you build a website or web app as a composition of features that you can create and work on separately.

We just published a course on the freeCodeCamp.org YouTube channel that will teach you all about micro-frontends.

Jack Herrington created this course. Jack has worked as a principle engineer and is an excellent teacher.

In this course, Jack will take you from just starting out, to understanding asynchronous loading, error handling, shared state, cross platform micro-frontends, how to route multiple applications together, and even how to test micro-frontend code.
