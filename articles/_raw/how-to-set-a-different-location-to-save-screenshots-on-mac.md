If you're coming to macOS from a different operating system (like Windows or Linux), it might feel odd that, by default, macOS saves screenshots in the Desktop folder. This make the desktop look messy after a while if you take a lot of screenshots!

But it doesn't look messy if you create a specific directory for saving all the screenshots and your MacBook saves all the screenshots there automatically. 

Configuring the settings might seem tricky for new MacBook users. So I will show you how you can do this within a few minutes with this step-by-step guide.

Keep in mind that although I am choosing the `Pictures/Screenshots` directory as my specific directory for saving all my screenshots, you can choose any directory you want.

For this article, I am using my newly purchased MacBook M1 Air (8/256) which is currently running on macOS Sonoma 14.4.1. But the same procedure is applicable for all the latest macOS versions as well.

## How to Choose a Different Location

Firstly, you need to select a specific location where you want to save all the screenshots directly. 

In my case, I created a separate folder for saving screenshots inside my "Pictures" directory.

## How to Configure the Screenshot Tool

Now we need to configure the default screenshot tool on macOS so that it automatically saves the screenshot images to our desired location. Here's how you can do that:

1. Use `Shift` + `Command` + `5` to open the screenshot tool.
2. Click on "Options". Then click "Other Location...".
3. Select that specific location that you created earlier. 
4. Now click "Ok", or "Open", or whatever it says to confirm that new location.

That's it! From now on, whenever you use the default screenshot tool, it will automatically save all the screenshots in that newly specified location. This will help your desktop remain clutter free!

## Screenshot Shortcut

There are many people who still open the Screenshot tool using Spotlight or the launchpad. But there is a dedicated shortcut key for that!

You can use `Shift` + `Command` + `3` to take screenshot directly and save yourself a little time.
