### Thought of the day:

> The automation of factories has already decimated jobs in traditional manufacturing, and the rise of artificial intelligence is likely to extend this job destruction deep into the middle classes, with only the most caring, creative or supervisory roles remaining.” — Stephen Hawking

### Image of the day:

Artist Scott Campbell [programmed a laser cutter](http://bit.ly/2lZlXPV) to carve a skull out of a two-foot stack of $11,000 worth in uncut US dollar bills.
