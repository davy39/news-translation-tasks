In your HTML documents, you'll often need to make a list of items. And you can use bullet points for this purpose.

You can show bullet points with the Unicode character (or entity) for bullet points.

In this article, I will show you the Unicode and HTML entities for showing bullet points on a web page. 

Towards the end of this article, I will also show you the 5-key combinations with which you can type a big dot symbol.

## The Unicode and HTML Entities for Bullet Points
The Unicode character for showing the dot symbol or bullet point is `U+2022`. 

But to use this Unicode correctly, remove the `U+` and replace it with ampersand (`&`), pound sign (`#`), and `x`. Then type the 2022 number in, and then add a semi-colon. So, it becomes `&#x2022;`. 

It'll look like this:
```html
<h1>Languages of the web</h1>
<h3>&#x2022; HTML</h3>
<h3>&#x2022; CSS</h3>
<h3>&#x2022; JavaScript</h3>
<h3>&#x2022; PHP</h3>
```

Apart from the `&#x2022;` Unicode character, you can also use `&bull;` and `&#8226;` HTML entitles to show bullets or dot symbols on the web page.

```html
<h1>Languages of the web</h1>
<h3>&#8226; HTML</h3>
<h3>&bull; CSS</h3>
<h3>&#8226; JavaScript</h3>
<h3>&bull; PHP</h3>
```
The output remains the same:

## The Keyboard Shortcut for Typing a Dot Symbol
To type the dot symbol on your keyboard, turn on the numeric keypad by pressing `NumLk`, hold `Alt` and press the `0`, `1`, `4`, and `9` keys in succession. 

If you don’t type the numbers with the numeric keypad, the dot symbol will not show.
