We just posted a course on the freeCodeCamp.org YouTube channel that will teach you all about cryptography. You'll learn essential techniques like hashing (SHA-256) for verifying file integrity, symmetric encryption (AES), and asymmetric encryption (RSA) using public and private keys. The practical focus of the tutorial involves building a fully functional command-line cryptography tool in Python. Upon completion, you'll have a complete practical toolkit and the skills to safeguard data, secure passwords, and deter tampering.

This course was developed by Thanishkka. She is part of Hack Club. Hack Club is a global non-profit organization that creates a community for high school students interested in coding and making things with technology.

Here are the sections in the course:

* Introduction: What is Cryptography?
    
* About Hack Club and the Course Creator
    
* Cryptography Basics & Cybershe Demo
    
* Three Main Areas: Hashing, Symmetric, and Asymmetric Encryption
    
* Deep Dive into Hashing (SHA 256) and File Integrity
    
* Symmetric Encryption with AES (Key, IV, and Modes)
    
* Asymmetric Encryption with RSA (Public and Private Keys)
    
* Setup: Python and VS Code Installation
    
* Creating and Activating a Virtual Environment
    
* Installing Required Python Libraries (cryptography, zxcvbn, bcrypt)
    
* Coding the File Hashing Function ([hash.py](http://hash.py))
    
* Coding the File Integrity Verification Function
    
* Coding AES Symmetric Encryption/Decryption ([encryption.py](http://encryption.py))
    
* Coding RSA Asymmetric Encryption/Decryption
    
* Coding the Password Strength Checker ([password.py](http://password.py))
    
* Coding Password Hashing and Verification (using bcrypt)
    
* Building the Command Line UI ([main.py](http://main.py))
    
* Final Toolkit Demo and Testing
    
* Conclusion and Next Steps
