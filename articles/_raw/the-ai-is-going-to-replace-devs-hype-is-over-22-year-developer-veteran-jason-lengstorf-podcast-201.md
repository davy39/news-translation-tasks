Today Quincy Larson interviews Jason Lengstorf. He's a college dropout who taught himself programming while building websites for his emo band. 22 years later he's worked as a developer at IBM, Netlify, run his own dev consultancy, and he now runs CodeTV making reality TV shows for developers.

We talk about:

* How many CEOs over-estimated the impact of AI coding tools and laid off too many devs, whom they're now trying to rehire
    
* Why the developer job market has already rebounded a bit, but will never be the same
    
* Tips for how to land roles in the post-LLM résumé spam job search era
    
* How devs are working to rebuild the fabric of the community through in-person community events

5. Today's song of the week is 1982's soul classic Risin' to the Top by Keni Burke. I love the laid back bass groove and spacious piano chords. The lyrics are about overcoming setbacks, which I know anyone who's attempted to learn programming can relate to. [https://youtu.be/euysGPy2t0M](https://youtu.be/euysGPy2t0M)
