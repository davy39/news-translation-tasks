On this week's episode of the podcast, I interview Scott Hanselman. Scott's a developer at Microsoft, a prolific teacher, and has hosted the Hanselminutes podcast for nearly two decades.

We talk about:

* How he leads a fully-remote team from his home of Portland, Oregon
    
* His 11-year journey to getting his degree
    
* What he learned from teaching programming at community college
    
* What he's learned about software development from recording 980 podcast interviews across 20 years
    

Can you guess what song I'm playing on my bass during the intro? It's from a 1994 punk song.
