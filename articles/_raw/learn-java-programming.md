Java has been one of the most popular programming languages for a long time. It is considered a general-purpose, concurrent, strongly typed, class-based object-oriented language.

We just published a full course on the freeCodeCamp.org YouTube channel that will teach you the Java programming language. This course is perfect for beginners.

We've published Java courses previously but this is one of the easiest ones yet to follow along with as a beginner. You can follow along with the entire course from within your web browser. And the course covers a newer version of Java than our previous courses.

Farhan Hasin Chowdhury created this course. Farhan is an experienced software engineer here at freeCodeCamp and he is great at breaking down programming topics for beginners.

_After this course you may understand the Java code in this XDCD comic. Or you can just [read an explanation](https://explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/1188:_Bonding)._

Here are the sections in this course:

* Hello World
* Variables
* Data Types
* Operators
* Strings
* User Inputs
* Conditional Statements
* Switch Cases
* Arrays
* For Loops
* While Loops
* Do...While Loops
