The iOS App Store submission process can feel like a daunting maze, but it doesn’t have to be.

We just posted a course on the [freeCodeCamp.org](http://freeCodeCamp.org) YouTube channel is designed to be your guide through this entire process, from start to finish. Shad Rayhan Mazumder developed this course.

Shad starts by explaining the traditional, manual method. This course will walk you through every essential step, explaining the foundational concepts of application IDs, certificates, and provisioning profiles. You’ll learn exactly what you need to do to generate the right credentials, register your devices, and get your app running on a physical iPhone or iPad for testing. The course also covers distributing ad hoc versions for testers before diving into the final steps for a public release.

The course then introduces the powerful concepts of Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD), specifically focusing on Apple’s own Xcode Cloud. You will learn how to push your latest changes to a GitHub repository and have your app automatically build, test, and distribute itself to your testers without you lifting another finger.

Watch the full course on [the freeCodeCamp.org YouTube channel](https://youtu.be/9vkkJ4tC4SQ) (2-hour watch).
