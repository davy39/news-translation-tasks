Stock screeners are used to scan and filter stocks. Did you know that you can make your own stock screener using Python for free?

We've released a full course on the freeCodeCamp.org YouTube channel that will show you how to use use the Ameritrade API to program a stock screener with Pandas and Python.

**This course is meant for educational purposes only. The information presented in this video is not investment advice.**

Sam Focht developed this course. He runs the Python Basics channel and has done a lot of live streams on the freeCodeCamp.org YouTube channel.

You can watch the [full course on the freeCodeCamp.org YouTube channel](https://youtu.be/HXGtLIoiv3Q) (70 minutes watch).
