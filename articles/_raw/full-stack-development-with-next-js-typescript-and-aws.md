Learn how create a full stack app with Next.js, TypeScript, and AWS Amplify.

We just publshed a new full stack app course on the freeCodeCamp.org YouTube channel. Brian H. Hough, a renowned software engineer and course creator, is your guide. He'll help you build an inspirational quote generator app.

You'll be working with Next.js, a popular React framework for building scalable and efficient web applications. TypeScript, a strongly-typed superset of JavaScript that offers more robust coding, will be your programming language. To ensure seamless deployment and hosting, you'll harness the power of AWS Amplify, a set of tools and services from Amazon Web Services that enables developers to build full-stack serverless applications.

Your journey starts with setting up a GitHub repository. Next, you create a project using Next.js and Styled Components. You'll give your app a unique touch. You'll add Google Fonts and a dynamic background. Plus, you'll design a footer and a Material-UI pop-up.

This course is practical. You'll write a Node.js script to generate images in CodeSandbox. Then, you'll use Node.js to call the ZenQuotes' API. 

The course goes deeper into backend development. You'll explore the AWS ecosystem. You'll use the AWS Amplify CLI, create a GraphQL API with AWS AppSync, and add authentication. That's done with Amazon Cognito and IAM. Also, you'll write and query NoSQL data with Amazon DynamoDB and AWS AppSync.

Deployment is another crucial part of this course. You'll deploy your AWS CloudFormation stack to the cloud. Next, you'll deploy your Node.js script to AWS Lambda and you'll ensure it has access to Amazon DynamoDB.

Debugging is a critical skill. You'll learn how to debug using Amazon CloudWatch Logs. You'll also troubleshoot your CI/CD Pipeline with AWS Amplify Build Settings.

At the end, you'll retrieve quotes with AWS Lambda, AWS AppSync, and IAM. You'll add app hosting with a CI/CD Pipeline. You'll use AWS Amplify and GitHub. Then, you'll celebrate your final build.

Whether you're a beginner or a seasoned coder, this course is for you. It's a great chance to enhance your skills. Watch the [full course](https://youtu.be/FRmCxj9K7II) on the freeCodeCamp.org YouTube channel (6-hour watch).
