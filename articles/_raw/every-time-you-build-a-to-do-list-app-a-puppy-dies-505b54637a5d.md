_You know when you’re trying to learn something new, but get reeeeeeallly bored of building the default example app?_

_That’s the №1 motivation KILLER._

_I don’t want my students to get demotivated and give up._

_So I made this gigantic list of 28 fun app ideas you can build while [learning to use React with Ruby on Rails](https://learnetto.com/users/hrishio/courses/the-free-react-on-rails-5-course?utm_source=fcc_medium&utm_campaign=blog_post_ideas_for_react_rails_apps&utm_medium=blog_post_ideas_for_react_rails_apps)._

_This list will assume that you’re already comfortable with Ruby on Rails (or some other web development framework). So the backend bit may be a bit complex for beginners, but the front end React bit should be relatively simple._

### _Project #1: A Calendar app for making appointments (like Google calendar)_

![Image](https://cdn-media-1.freecodecamp.org/images/IWZRzhKDlxFeYHIqutwyoP8rS60VLb6RjXWl)
_[A simple calendar appointments app](https://github.com/learnetto/calreact" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title=")_

_This can start off as a simple app which you can gradually improve by adding more features and UX improvements._

_It will help you practice using nested components (like a day component, nested inside a week component, or a nested inside a month component)._

_I use this as an example app in my [Free Complete React on Rails course](https://learnetto.com/users/hrishio/courses/the-complete-react-on-rails-5-course?utm_source=fcc_medium&utm_campaign=blog_post_ideas_for_react_rails_apps&utm_medium=blog_post_ideas_for_react_rails_apps). So check it out if you want to try this out._

_You can see the full step-by-step code here:_

### _Project #2: A Github explorer app for finding interesting code repositories_

![Image](https://cdn-media-1.freecodecamp.org/images/Xt5zXCZwQnQV2dy9yiCIeSqyCgL4-YbLQV25)
_[https://github.algolia.com](https://github.algolia.com" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title=")_

_You can build the search part purely on the client side, but you can make it more fun by storing the searches in a database using Rails and show the most popular searches._

_You will practice using an external API and handling the JSON response. You could experiment with pre-rendering the component on the server._

_See this browser plugin by [Algolia](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/every-time-you-build-a-to-do-list-app-a-puppy-dies-505b54637a5d/undefined) to get your idea juices flowing:_

_[github-awesome-autocomplete - :octocat: Add instant search capabilities to GitHub's search bar](https://github.com/algolia/github-awesome-autocomplete)github.com_

### _Project #3: A note-taking app_

![Image](https://cdn-media-1.freecodecamp.org/images/2HsQXdpMsK0DdUvV7u3K6e1pKncTMrYHkxPq)
_Simplenote_

_You could see the power of React handling a lot of state changes, say, by enabling auto-save. Check out [Simplenote](https://simplenote.com/) for a good example of a simple but powerful notes app._

_If that’s too hard as a first app, you could first try out using an [external text editor component](https://facebook.github.io/draft-js/) to learn how it works, and then implement your own:_

_[**facebook/draft-js**](https://github.com/facebook/draft-js)_  
_[draft-js - A React framework for building text editors.](https://github.com/facebook/draft-js)github.com_

### _Project #4: Add a Slack chat widget to your site_

![Image](https://cdn-media-1.freecodecamp.org/images/XDxAVff76ErKvdEkJfYdQI7ztJ84sXHyiPd8)

_Use the [react-slack-chat](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-slack-chat) component to add a chat widget to your existing Rails site. The component does most of the heavy lifting but you can have fun by making your own bot in Rails and customizing the widget in React._

_The code for the component is on Github:_

_[react-slack-chat - A Beautiful Gooey / Material Design Slack Chat Web Integrating Widget.](https://github.com/5punk/react-slack-chat)github.com_

### _Project #5: Meme generator_

![Image](https://cdn-media-1.freecodecamp.org/images/6ZBtQjOclCw0WcpTjW48ZA2uVNZIsUWnGJ6T)

_Rails can handle storing and serving an image library and existing memes. Use React for rendering and handling the form for making the meme._

_You could generate the meme on the server using ImageMagick or in the browser using canvas. See [this repo](https://github.com/tranhungt/meme-maker) by [Hung Tran](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/every-time-you-build-a-to-do-list-app-a-puppy-dies-505b54637a5d/undefined):_

### _Project #6: Realtime Free Image search app_

![Image](https://cdn-media-1.freecodecamp.org/images/CVdLOvWnZmefgdTbgRbbdEkPsI5otkto-3-B)
_Help Medium bloggers find their inner [hispter](https://unsplash.com/collections/397770/coffee-house?photo=d0QWndxSR38" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title=")_

_Use the [Unsplash](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/every-time-you-build-a-to-do-list-app-a-puppy-dies-505b54637a5d/undefined) [API](https://unsplash.com/developers) for the high quality free photos:_

_[**unsplash/unsplash_rb**](https://github.com/unsplash/unsplash_rb)_  
_[unsplash_rb - Ruby wrapper for the Unsplash API.](https://github.com/unsplash/unsplash_rb)github.com_

_Add cool animations using the [React Animation Add-Ons](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/animation.html)._

_Allow users to bookmark their favorite images. You could even experiment with making the backend just a Rails API app and make a separate React app for the front end._

### _Project #7: Book club_

![Image](https://cdn-media-1.freecodecamp.org/images/y4TOG12nCUnXwDCkv6kdgMmjPjJeSZcqw3P6)
_Goodreads is a great site to copy for this project_

_A simple app where you and your friends can share your favorite books and discuss them (like [Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com)). The backend could be a simple Rails CRUD app, but you could make the front end a single page React app and play with React router and Redux._

### _Project #8: Twitter web client for multiple accounts (like Tweetdeck)_

![Image](https://cdn-media-1.freecodecamp.org/images/IldLnEczNbTFIT-tqmYCYN-RzyK9IybgUml3)
_I use [Tweetdeck](https://tweetdeck.twitter.com" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title=") for running my personal and business Twitter accounts from one place_

_A Twitter web client app in which you can connect more than one Twitter account (using OAuth) and then add multiple columns to the UI — for things like the feed, notifications, search, direct messages._

_Use the Twitter gem by [Erik Michaels-Ober](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/every-time-you-build-a-to-do-list-app-a-puppy-dies-505b54637a5d/undefined):_

_[**sferik/twitter**](https://github.com/sferik/twitter)_  
_[twitter - A Ruby interface to the Twitter API.](https://github.com/sferik/twitter)github.com_

_This will give you the unparalleled joy of dealing with the ridiculous API rate limits from the most developer-friendly company in the world._

_You could add Tweetdeck-style automatic fetching of new tweets and notifications using polling or Action Cable._

_Lots of nested components and you can try out some simple animations in React._

_It might be best to start off with building just reading capabilities. Once you have that, you can add the ability to post, like and retweet._

### _Project #9: OpenStreetMap Custom UI_

![Image](https://cdn-media-1.freecodecamp.org/images/eZiSwhi22WKGfgovWcGZBjfsZnagMO2Rmj8y)
_My hometown Pune (India) on [OpenStreetMap](http://www.openstreetmap.org/node/16174445#map=10/18.5564/73.9243" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title=") :)_

_Did you know the [OpenStreetMap website](http://www.openstreetmap.org) is a Rails app?_

_You can [get the repo here](https://github.com/openstreetmap/openstreetmap-website/), [set it up](https://github.com/openstreetmap/openstreetmap-website/blob/master/INSTALL.md) on your own machine and then tinker with adding React to the front end!_

### _Project #10: Team lunch roulette_

![Image](https://cdn-media-1.freecodecamp.org/images/ZH8L223oEDfd2tGyluOF1A8RjDvXcYjJhbuv)
_Check out [NEVERBLAND](http://whatsforlunchshoreditch.com/" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="">http://whatsforlunchshoreditch.com</a> built by <a href="undefined" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title=")_

_A website for helping you decide where to go for lunch with your team. The Rails backend just needs to be a simple CRUD app which lets team members enter place suggestions. You could use the [Foursquare API](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/every-time-you-build-a-to-do-list-app-a-puppy-dies-505b54637a5d/undefined) for search and auto complete._

_And use React for some ridiculous animations!_

_If you’re not into lunch, do coffee or cocktails or something else more exciting._

### _Project #11: Super Procrastinator_

![Image](https://cdn-media-1.freecodecamp.org/images/DOBu6dKiZmwzQ3Y1fl9GiNd2rm6IAbsn8QBf)
_[http://reader.one/](http://reader.one/" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title=")_

_A single website you can go to avoid work — read Reddit, Hacker News, [Product Hunt](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/every-time-you-build-a-to-do-list-app-a-puppy-dies-505b54637a5d/undefined), Medium, Slashdot and more in one place._

_Use the Rails backend for saving user accounts and preferences, and talking to the different APIs. You could also fetch data from the APIs directly from the client side._

> _Want to build these apps with me? Come, check out my [Free Complete React on Rails Course](https://learnetto.com/users/hrishio/courses/the-complete-react-on-rails-5-course?utm_source=fcc_medium&utm_campaign=blog_post_ideas_for_react_rails_apps&utm_medium=blog_post_ideas_for_react_rails_apps), where I will teach you how to be a pro at [using React with Rails](https://learnetto.com/users/hrishio/courses/the-complete-react-on-rails-5-course?utm_source=fcc_medium&utm_campaign=blog_post_ideas_for_react_rails_apps&utm_medium=blog_post_ideas_for_react_rails_apps), while building some fun stuff._

### _Project #12: Chatroom with Action Cable_

![Image](https://cdn-media-1.freecodecamp.org/images/brVbyPrTUWgWjLMmbB9LoAaHISYXYfdjtFIw)
_Remember [AIM](https://www.flickr.com/photos/katemo/2372403984/in/photostream/" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title=")?_

_In addition to learning React, this would make a great little project to try out [Action Cable](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/action_cable_overview.html), a cool new Rails 5 feature which adds WebSocket support to Rails. See [these examples](https://github.com/rails/actioncable-examples) to get started:_

_[**rails/actioncable-examples**](https://github.com/rails/actioncable-examples)_

### _Project #13: Extra Small (A [Medium](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/every-time-you-build-a-to-do-list-app-a-puppy-dies-505b54637a5d/undefined) clone)_

![Image](https://cdn-media-1.freecodecamp.org/images/GH-0Xqfn1aPLyBqQTkJIXo0TWf4qNDkUqi7P)
_Because extra small is extra beautiful!_

_Check out [this series of blog posts](http://fancypixel.github.io/blog/2015/01/28/react-plus-flux-backed-by-rails-api/) by [Andrea Mazzini](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/every-time-you-build-a-to-do-list-app-a-puppy-dies-505b54637a5d/undefined), in which he describes in detail how he built a Medium clone with a Rails API app, React and Flux._

_[small-rails - Small, a tiny clone of Medium. Rails API](https://github.com/FancyPixel/small-rails)github.com_[**FancyPixel/small-frontend**](https://github.com/FancyPixel/small-frontend)  
_[small-frontend - Small, a tiny clone of Medium. React + Flux frontend](https://github.com/FancyPixel/small-frontend)github.com_

_You can build it without using Flux, but it might be worth a try if you’re up for the challenge._

### _Project #14: Face tagger_

_D to da A to da V to da I to da D to da C_

_An app where you can upload photos and tag people (like on Facebook). Use the [OpenCV Ruby gem](https://github.com/ruby-opencv/ruby-opencv) for automatic face detection:_

### _Project #15: ActiveAdmin on steroids_

![Image](https://cdn-media-1.freecodecamp.org/images/lbitvQ4emipgw3lZ6OctW1-bXfGU-kpCm0Cv)
_[ActiveAdmin](http://activeadmin.info/" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title=") default UI_

_You’ve probably used [ActiveAdmin](http://activeadmin.info/) for managing your app records. But the UI is not exactly inspiring. You can change that by taking one view at a time and turning it into a nicely styled React component._

_Look into the ActiveAdmin code here:_

_[**activeadmin/activeadmin**](https://github.com/activeadmin/activeadmin)_  
_[activeadmin - The administration framework for Ruby on Rails applications.](https://github.com/activeadmin/activeadmin)github.com_

### _Project #16: An Ecommerce Store_

![Image](https://cdn-media-1.freecodecamp.org/images/2OcJhfGdoOSwYnBqTRRC9Cva-iidVZ6N4Rwj)
_Sunlit uplands as a service_

_Jam, beer, England flags, curry, all served by React on Rails. If you don’t want to build up the store features in Rails, just use [Spree](https://spreecommerce.com/) and focus on practicing React components for the front end._

_[**spree/spree**](https://github.com/spree/spree)_  
_[spree - Spree is a complete open source e-commerce solution for Ruby on Rails.](https://github.com/spree/spree)github.com_

#### _Guess what? I’m building this online store idea in a series of tutorials. The first one will be published right here on the freeCodeCamp blog! Make sure you follow me on Medium and [sign up on Learnetto](https://learnetto.com/tutorials) to get it in your inbox._

### _Project #17: Just Mail No Chimp_

![Image](https://cdn-media-1.freecodecamp.org/images/Z26r8KFExCLrXmJEKPjVYhhNknihh0RIME4f)
_I have a love-hate relationship with Mailchimp_

_An email newsletter app with a good UI that doesn’t make you want to tear your hair out. And no cute monkey nonsense ?_

_You can still use the [Mailchimp API](https://developer.mailchimp.com/) or use [Sendgrid](https://sendgrid.com/). If you’ve used Mailchimp, you know there are a ton of features you can try building — viewing/filtering/managing subscribers, designing forms, creating campaigns, and more._

_Just pick one feature and try to build it. Most features will involve some kind of form, so it should be good practice for dividing your UI into React components that will handle state and some stateless functional components._

### _Project #18: Gmail on Rails_

![Image](https://cdn-media-1.freecodecamp.org/images/IOkVzM0TYHyhUrYvrMSNDdCmfuKIu6S5cMGG)
_[LeBron James’ Inbox (2012)](http://mashable.com/2012/07/24/lebron-james-email-hacked/#Jq6nK.otogqq" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title=")_

_Gmail has a pretty complex UI but you could start off by just building the UI for listing and reading emails. Or maybe search could be more fun?_

_Use the [google-api-client gem](https://developers.google.com/gmail/api/quickstart/ruby) and check out this awesome React tutorial and code repo by [Mark Brown ☕](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/every-time-you-build-a-to-do-list-app-a-puppy-dies-505b54637a5d/undefined) to get started:_

### _Project #19: DJ Spotify_

![Image](https://cdn-media-1.freecodecamp.org/images/c7mlZrq3YjmyIWGyApDBsS9Mw7itG5wgH3xa)

_A DJ’ing app built on top of [Spotify](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/every-time-you-build-a-to-do-list-app-a-puppy-dies-505b54637a5d/undefined). Get recommendations, create and mix playlists and even allow others to add songs to your playlists._

_Use a [Ruby wrapper](https://github.com/guilhermesad/rspotify) gem for the Spotify API:_

_[**guilhermesad/rspotify**](https://github.com/guilhermesad/rspotify)_  
_[rspotify - A ruby wrapper for the Spotify Web API](https://github.com/guilhermesad/rspotify)github.com_

_I’ve built a [tiny little app](http://songshaker.herokuapp.com/) with it before and it’s quite easy to use. Spotify only allows the music itself to be played with their own apps, so you have to keep the app running alongside._

### _Project #20: Heroku dashboard_

![Image](https://cdn-media-1.freecodecamp.org/images/zqRDjulyUaQ-EszbWouRoHjMwPU84UoGnDoc)

_As a Rails developer, you’re probably very familiar with [Heroku](https://heroku.com). It’s an awesome service for quickly deploying and hosting Rails apps — perfect when you’re making lots of little things for learning_

_Build a simple dashboard which lists your apps and lets you quickly view key information about each of them. You can add editing capabilities as a second step._

_Use this gem to access the Heroku API:_

_[**heroku/platform-api**](https://github.com/heroku/platform-api)_

![Image](https://cdn-media-1.freecodecamp.org/images/BWzidSv2aWTkTYblW37NnkeWN1fe3nz3Wts1)
_UI design ‘95_

_Build a nice modern UI for managing your AWS S3 account. Use the [Ruby gem](https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-ruby) and start off by building a simple file browser component. Then add a form component to upload files._

_Check out [https://demo.baremetrics.com/](undefined" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="">Baremetrics</a> for some inspiration — <a href="https://demo.baremetrics.com/" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title=")_

_A dashboard for showing some statistics and charts based on [Stripe](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/every-time-you-build-a-to-do-list-app-a-puppy-dies-505b54637a5d/undefined) data. The API is [very well documented](https://stripe.com/docs/api/ruby) and this is a great chance to try using D3 with React (look at [this](http://www.reactd3.org/) and [this](https://github.com/QubitProducts/d3-react-sparkline))._

### _Project #23: Google analytics dashboard_

![Image](https://cdn-media-1.freecodecamp.org/images/wkGB2Fq0PFO-j3hNjrwIwAnXcYrE3fhPuoIa)
_Look at the GA iPad app for inspiration (it’s much nicer than the website)_

_The default Google analytics web dashboard is cluttered and confusing. You could build a simpler one which just shows the most important information._

_Another chance to use D3 or you could try [another library](https://github.com/reactjs/react-chartjs)._

_You can access the GA API with [this gem](https://developers.google.com/api-client-library/ruby/apis/analytics/v3)._

### _Project #24: Habit Tracker_

![Image](https://cdn-media-1.freecodecamp.org/images/KcvzBu8Wdc1pDC6h0YZ85XoILjlIMumvrgZH)
_The [Loop Habit Tracker](https://github.com/iSoron/uhabits" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title=") has a nice simple UI_

_Build an app for tracking your daily and weekly habits — morning routines, gym sessions, running, cooking, meditation, guitar practice, tea ceremonies?_

_For inspiration, check out the [Loop Habit Tracker](https://github.com/iSoron/uhabits) or [Coach](https://www.coach.me/habit-tracker)._

_Make it mobile-friendly so that you can use it on the go. Once you’re comfortable with React, you could even build a mobile app using React Native._

### _Project #25: Fitness dashboard_

_Check out [Belle Beth Cooper](https://exist.io/" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="">Exist</a> for inspiration (built by <a href="undefined" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="">Josh Sharp</a> and <a href="undefined" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="))_

_Build a dashboard for all your personal fitness data, that pulls in data from different apps and presents some useful statistics in a nice UI._

_Depending on what you, your family and friends use, you could easily pull in data from a number of APIs — [Fitbit](https://github.com/whazzmaster/fitgem), [Google Fit](https://developers.google.com/api-client-library/ruby/apis/fitness/v1), [Moves](https://dev.moves-app.com/docs/guide), [Runkeeper](https://runkeeper.com/developer/healthgraph/overview), [Strava](https://github.com/jaredholdcroft/strava-api-v3), [Withings](http://oauth.withings.com/api) and lots more!_

_You could even allow the user to manually enter data for simple things like weight tracking and exercise routines._

_You could start off by just showing reports and then enhance it with new features like adding notes and sharing._

_I’ve built a simple dashboard for Fitbit data. See the code here:_

_[Google Quick Draw](https://quickdraw.withgoogle.com/" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title=")_

_Make a drawing app in which you can draw with a mouse, and a friend has to guess what you drew. You can use canvas for drawing. See [react-sketchpad](https://github.com/svrcekmichal/react-sketchpad) by [Michal Svrček](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/every-time-you-build-a-to-do-list-app-a-puppy-dies-505b54637a5d/undefined) for some ideas on how to start:_

_Use Rails to upload and save the drawing and show it to someone on another computer._

_As an advanced exercise in fun, add [machine learning](https://gist.github.com/gbuesing/865b814d312f46775cda) and make the computer guess ?_

### _Project #27: You Write Like_

![Image](https://cdn-media-1.freecodecamp.org/images/x9knrRpK9Dx-sOMJq3MGGZvMQLHw14DgkUr9)
_Always good to know who inspires famous internet people_

_Make a text classifier app which matches your writing style to a famous author — just like [I Write Like](https://iwl.me/) (made by [Dmitry Chestnykh](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/every-time-you-build-a-to-do-list-app-a-puppy-dies-505b54637a5d/undefined))._

_Use [classifier-reborn](https://github.com/jekyll/classifier-reborn) for classifying the text and React for handling the form. This app is mostly backend-heavy, so experiment with some [UI animations](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/animation.html). See [this repo](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/react-animations) for some cool ideas:_

_An Idea Board app with idea tiles_

_Build an Idea board app using a [Rails 5.1 API app and a separate React app](https://learnetto.com/tutorials/rails-5-api-and-react-js-tutorial-how-to-make-an-idea-board-app) built using Create React App. The Idea board is a simple board which displays ideas in the form of square tiles. You can add ideas, edit existing ideas and delete ideas._
