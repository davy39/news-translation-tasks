Are you looking for a way to apply Python and machine learning to a real-world application? You should consider Bioinformatics.

Bioinformatics is an interdisciplinary field that develops methods and software tools for understanding biological data, in particular when the data sets are large and complex.

We just released a course that will teach you how to use Python and machine learning to build a bioinformatics project for drug discovery.

 Chanin Nantasenamat (aka Data Professor) developed this course. He is an associate professor of bioinformatics and he knows how to break things down for beginners.

You don't have to know anything about bioinformatics to follow along. 

The course covers collecting datasets, preprocessing the datasets, and performing exploratory data analysis. You will learn to build machine learning models in order to make predictions and obtain data-driven insights that will be useful for drug discovery. Then you will learn how to compare models and select the right one for the use case.

Here are the sections covered in this course:

* Data collection
* Exploratory data analysis
* Descriptor calculation
* Model building
* Model comparison
* Model deployment

Watch the course below or on [the freeCodeCamp.org YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBlTQjcKuaY) (2-hour watch).
