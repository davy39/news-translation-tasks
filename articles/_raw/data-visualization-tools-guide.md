Data visualization is the process of interpreting or representing data graphically. Generally, it is the graphical or visual representation of data using charts, tables, histograms, and other info-graphics.

Data plays a major role in any type of organization. Data visualization helps us understand certain trends and insights, and make important decisions based on them.

Through visual representation, you can show complex loads of data in a very simplistic manner.

## What Are Data Visualization Tools?

Imagine going through a record of one million users and grouping them based on their age range. That would be a very tedious task.

Data visualization tools extract information from such records and present them to you or to anyone who needs the data in a visual way.

In the next section, you'll see some of the best data visualization tools to choose from.

## Top Data Visualization Tools

In this section, we'll go over the features and availability/pricing plans of various data visualization tools. There are not listed in any specific order.
