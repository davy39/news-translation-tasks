Laravel is a popular PHP web development framework known for its elegant syntax, developer-friendly tools, and built-in features for routing, authentication, and database interactions. It's an excellent choice for both beginners and experienced developers looking to create full-featured web applications quickly and efficiently.

We just published a course on the freeCodeCamp.org YouTube channel that will teach you how to build a fully-functional Medium clone using the Laravel PHP framework. Taught by The Codeholic, this in-depth, hands-on course takes you from setting up your Laravel environment to developing advanced features like user profiles, following/unfollowing other users, and managing blog posts. By the end, you'll not only understand Laravel's core features but also how to put them together to build a real-world social publishing platform.

The course kicks off with an introduction and a demo of the final app, then walks you through the entire development process. You'll learn how to set up a Laravel project, use Artisan (Laravel’s command-line tool), and configure your app. From there, you’ll implement user registration and login using Laravel Breeze, enable email verification, and work with Tinker to interact with your database.

Throughout the course, you'll explore key Laravel concepts such as models, migrations, factories, and seeders, and you'll make use of Blade templating, components, and layouts to build dynamic and reusable UI elements. You’ll also build critical features like post creation and editing, pagination, category filtering, image uploads and resizing, and user interactions such as liking posts and following other users.

By following along, you'll gain a deep understanding of Laravel’s MVC architecture, database relationships, form validation, and more.
