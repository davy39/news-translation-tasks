If you're interested in data science but not sure where to begin, Python is a great starting point. It’s easy to pick up and has a bunch of libraries that make working with data a lot easier.

We just published a course on the [freeCodeCamp.org](http://freeCodeCamp.org) YouTube channel that teaches you how to do data science using Python. Frank Andrade developed this course.

It starts with installation and setup, then covers Python fundamentals so you’re not lost if you’ve never coded before. From there, it gets into two of the most commonly used libraries in data science: Pandas and NumPy. Pandas helps you work with tables of data (think spreadsheets, but in Python), and NumPy is great for doing math on that data.

You’ll get to apply what you're learning right away with hands-on projects. The first one shows you how to scrape data from websites using Pandas. Then you’ll learn how to filter and clean that data, reshape it, and create pivot tables. There's also a project where you’ll build charts and graphs so you can actually visualize what the data is telling you. You’ll use real datasets and build things like bar charts and scatter plots to explore trends and patterns.

Once you're comfortable with those basics, the course introduces more useful techniques like using `groupby` and aggregate functions, combining different data sets, and using regular expressions to pull out specific patterns from text. These are skills you’ll need for any real data job, or even if you’re just trying to make sense of a big messy spreadsheet.

Later in the course, you'll start working with machine learning. It’s not super advanced, but it gives you a solid first look at how it works. You’ll use scikit-learn to build a simple text classification model. Basically, you’ll train a program to read some text and decide what category it belongs to. Think spam vs. not spam, or positive vs. negative reviews.

If you're new to data science and want to actually try things instead of just reading about them, this course is a solid pick. Everything is broken into small, manageable sections, and the projects help the ideas stick. It’s free, it’s on YouTube, and you can follow along at your own pace.
