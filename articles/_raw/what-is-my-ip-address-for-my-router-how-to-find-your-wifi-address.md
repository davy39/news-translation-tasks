Sometimes you might need to know your router’s IP address. This will give you access to the setup page so you can make configuration changes like changing passwords, kicking out unwanted users, limiting users, and so on.

In this article, I will show you how to find out what your router IP address is on a Windows machine and Android smartphone.

## What is an IP Address?

But before we jump in, let's clarify – what is an IP address?

The abbreviation IP stands for “internet protocol”. The internet protocol is a set of rules governing how computers, phones, and other devices share data over the internet or local networks. 

An IP address is a special numerical identifier that allows information to be sent between various devices on a network. 

## How to Find your Wifi Address on a Windows Computer

To find out what the IP address of your router is (or of any other device on which you have access to its Wifi), you can either use the command prompt or gain access to it through the control panel.

### How to Find your Wifi Address on a Windows Computer through the Command Prompt

**Step 1**: Click on Start (Windows logo) or press the `WIN` on your keyboard.
**Step 2**: Search for “cmd” and hit `ENTER` to launch the command prompt.

The number assigned to “Default Gateway” is your router’s IP address.

## How to Find your Wifi Address on an Android Smartphone

Android devices do not have a built-in option to check the router’s addresses out of the box. But you can use a third-party app like Wifi Analyzer.

If you have Wifi Analyzer installed on your Android smartphone, launch the app.
