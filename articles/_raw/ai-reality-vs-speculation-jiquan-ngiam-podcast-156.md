On this week's episode of the podcast, I interview Jiquan Ngiam. He's a former Google Brain engineer who's building tools to make AI useful for everyone – not just developers.

We talk about the power of AI and it's practical capabilities, and separate those from a lot of the hype surrounding the AI space.

We talk about:

* How AI agents work
    
* Where AI is going and its limitations
    
* How non-developers can leverage AI
    
* And how developers can REALLY leverage AI
    

You can watch the interview on YouTube:
