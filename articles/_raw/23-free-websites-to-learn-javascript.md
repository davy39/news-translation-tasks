JavaScript is a programming language that's used for a variety of purposes, including web development, web apps, game development, and more.

JavaScript also lets you add dynamic features to web sites that you can't just achieve with HTML and CSS.

## Importance of JavaScript

JavaScript is the most important language you need to learn as a frontend developer. It's a great first language for web developers to learn because:

1. Web apps are dynamic because of JavaScript.
    
2. When it comes to responsive design, JavaScript comes in handy.
    
3. For backend and server-side programming, JavaScript is one of the most effective languages.
    

JavaScript makes up a crucial part of the structure of any website, along with HTML and CSS:

* **HTML** forms the basic structure of the website.
    
* **CSS** is used for styling the websites.
    
* **JavaScript** makes the website dynamic and allows you to add some animation.
    

When you're starting to learn about web development basics, the vast amount of resources out there might overwhelm you. So in this guide, I'm sharing some of my favorite resources to learn JavaScript to help you get started.

## 25 Free Websites to Learn JavaScript

### 1\. [freeCodeCamp.org](https://www.freecodecamp.org/)

freeCodeCamp.org is a 501(c)3 non-profit organisation that can help you learn to code for **free**, build real-world projects, and prepare for getting your first (or nth) developer job.

It is one of the most exceptional communities and learning websites for developers. Its project-based curriculum will help you solidify the skills you're learning as you go, and its community of helpful volunteers and other campers can offer support when you need it.

freeCodeCamp also has a [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8butISFwT-Wl7EV0hUK0BQ), publication, and [forum](https://forum.freecodecamp.org/) to help you learn topics like Python, JavaScript, data science and machine learning, web development, web design, and a whole lot more.

### 2\. [JavaScript 30](https://javascript30.com/)

JavaScript 30 helps you build things with code. Lots of things. Build 1,000 things. Seriously. It also contains a lot of free JavaScript tutorials and lessons.

#### JavaScript tutorials by JavaScript 30:

### 3\. [CodeMentor](https://www.codementor.io/)

Code Mentor offers a 4-week course to learn JavaScript. Yeah, another impressive site for JavaScript tutorials.

You can even book a 1:1 class with a mentor, which will cost you money (About $15 per hour). You will not only learn about core JavaScript but also about other famous JavaScript libraries and related concepts like Ajax, Json, jQuery, Angular JS, and more.

### 4\. [Educative.io – Learn HTML, CSS, and JavaScript from Scratch](https://www.educative.io/courses/learn-html-css-javascript-from-scratch)

This course is made by Educative. Learn to code and create your own web pages using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in this interactive web development course for beginners.

Instead of watching endless videos and wondering how to translate those videos into proper code, you'll be practicing what you learn through interactive, test-based exercises.

[Here is an introduction to JavaScript course for complete beginners](https://www.educative.io/courses/introduction-to-javascript-first-steps). It'll take you through the fundamentals of the language. Topics include variables, operators, functions, arrays, objects, and loops.

This course is not completely free, but you can take a free trial to watch this course.

### 5\. [Learn JavaScript - Full Course for Beginners](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkZNo7MFNFg) from freeCodeCamp

This is not a website – instead it's a YouTube course by freeCodeCamp. I'm recommending this video because it contains a lot of value in it.

This complete 134 part JavaScript tutorial for beginners will teach you everything you need to know to get started with the JavaScript programming language.

### 6\. [JavaScript.info](https://javascript.info/)

Learn JavaScript from the basics to advanced topics with simple yet detailed explanations. As the name implies, this website's tutorials are focused on JavaScript only.

And it has a really great interactive JavaScript course that'll help you learn online at your own pace.

No matter your experience level, you'll be writing real, functional code while learning with Sololearn.

These courses were designed by experts with real-world practice. You can also earn certificates, but you have to get the PRO version of Sololearn for that \[ $12/mo \].

edX offers a bunch of free courses, including JavaScript courses that were made by different universities, like Harvard and other prestigious schools.

All of the courses themselves are 100% free on edX – but if you want a certificate, you will need to pay some money for it. This seems reasonable, as they will come from they the top universities like MIT, and Harvard, but don't forget that there are other options that don't charge a penny.

### 12\. [Mozilla Developer Network](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/23-free-websites-to-learn-javascript/developer.mozilla.org)

Mozilla Developer Network or MDN is more like documentation that developers can read and learn from.

Many developers who use MDN are quite knowledgeable about various programming languages, and have been coding for a long time. So I don't necessarily recommend MDN for beginners. But there are a lot of answers to be found there if you put in the time and effort.

### 13\. [Code Combat](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/23-free-websites-to-learn-javascript/codecombat.com)

You can also apply for a scholarship if you can't afford the paid courses or certificates, and Coursera is great about offering these scholarships to those in need.
