One of the first things that you are instructed to do when you start to learn to program, or when you are simply learning a new programming language, is doing something really simple. One of the first steps that you do is print a simple text. As you are reading this, you probably may know which text is the most common and the one that I am referring to.

The text that I am talking about is *Hello World.*

This text is supposed to be for you as a way of greeting the world as you have just embarked on an important journey. A journey of learning as much as possible.

A GitHub [repository](https://github.com/Omkar-Ajnadkar/Hello-World) has already been prepared with taking examples from as many programming languages and putting them in a commonplace so that other people can see how this same procedure is done in different programming languages.

This simple task implemented in Java, JavaScript, Python, Ruby, C++ and many other languages is already in there. Until now, this repository has taken a lot of contributions, to a lot of programming languages, even in many of which you and I may have never heard of before.

It is open-source and you can also [contribute](https://github.com/Omkar-Ajnadkar/Hello-World) to it if you know any other programming language that is not listed in there.
