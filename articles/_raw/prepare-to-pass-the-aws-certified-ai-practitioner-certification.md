The AWS Certified AI Practitioner certification is a valuable credential that validates your understanding of AI, ML, and generative AI concepts and use cases.

We just published a course on the [freeCodeCamp.org](http://freeCodeCamp.org) YouTube channel that will help you prepare for and pass the AWS Certified AI Practitioner Certification. This comprehensive course is designed to equip you with the essential knowledge and skills needed to pass the AWS Certified AI Practitioner exam and advance your career in the rapidly evolving fields of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML). Andrew Brown from ExamPro developed this course.

### Why Pursue the AWS Certified AI Practitioner Certification?

The AWS Certified AI Practitioner certification is ideal for professionals who are familiar with AI/ML technologies on AWS but do not necessarily build AI/ML solutions. This certification can significantly enhance your competitive edge, positioning you for career growth and higher earnings.

According to a November 2023 AWS study, employers are willing to pay significantly more for AI-skilled workers across various roles. For instance, AI expertise can lead to a 43% salary increase in sales and marketing, 42% in finance, 41% in business operations, and 47% in IT. By obtaining this certification, you can demonstrate your proficiency in AI and ML, making you a more attractive candidate in the job market.

### Course Overview

This course offers a detailed curriculum that covers a wide range of topics essential for the AWS Certified AI Practitioner exam. Here are the sections in the course:

* Introduction
    
* AI and ML Fundamentals
    
* Data
    
* Gen AI Primer
    
* Bedrock
    
* Datastores for GenAI
    
* PartyRock

### Who Should Take This Course?

This course is perfect for individuals who are new to IT and AWS Cloud, as well as those who already hold the AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner or an Associate-level AWS Certification. If you are starting from scratch, we recommend beginning with AWS Cloud Practitioner Essentials or AWS Technical Essentials before diving into this AI-focused training.

### How Does This Certification Differ from Others?

While the AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner certification provides a foundational overview of all AWS services, the AWS Certified AI Practitioner certification delves deeply into AI frameworks, concepts, and AWS technologies, with a special focus on generative AI. This makes it an excellent choice for those specifically interested in AI and ML.

### Conclusion

Whether you are looking to enhance your skills for a current role or pivot to a new career path, our AWS Certified AI Practitioner course is an important resource. Watch the full course on [the freeCodeCamp.org YouTube channel](https://youtu.be/WZeZZ8_W-M4) (15-hour watch).
