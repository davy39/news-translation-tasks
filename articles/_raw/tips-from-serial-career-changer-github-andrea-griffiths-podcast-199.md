Today Quincy Larson interviews Andrea Griffiths, who taught herself programming using freeCodeCamp while working in construction. She moved to the US from Colombia when she was 17, and within 6 months she joined the US Army. She ran a chain of gyms before landing a support role at a tech company, then ascending to Product Manager and ultimately Developer Advocate at GitHub.

We talk about:

* Tips for busy parents who want to learn new skills.
    
* How AI tools are no substitute for your own critical thinking and problem solving skills.
    
* How even though it's getting easier every day to learn programming for free, people are so distracted, and for many it feels harder and harder to sit down and do it.
