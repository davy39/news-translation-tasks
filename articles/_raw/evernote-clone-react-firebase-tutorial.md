In this intermediate React.js tutorial from PortEXE, you will learn how to create a clone of the popular note-taking application Evernote. This app allows users to create notes with a full text editor, and update live to a database using Firebase.

The Evernote clone features creating, editing, and removing notes. The notes are saved in the cloud using Cloud Firestore from Firebase.

You can watch the full video course on the [freeCodeCamp.org YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I250xdtUvy8) (2 hour watch).
