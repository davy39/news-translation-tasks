On this week's episode of the podcast, freeCodeCamp founder Quincy Larson interviews Scott Tolinski. He's a developer who 14 years ago - after injuring himself breakdancing – decided to create a programming tutorial YouTube channel called LevelUpTuts.

We talk about:  
\- Scott's perspective on the state of web dev  
\- His journey from video editing into full blown software development for agencies  
\- What he's learned from recording 2,000 tutorials and 800 web dev podcasts  
\- Productivity tips and how he's kept up this pace for 12 years without burning out
