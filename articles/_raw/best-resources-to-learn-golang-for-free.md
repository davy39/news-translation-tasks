Golang has been around for a while now, and it's become quite popular among developers.

It is a simple yet compelling programming language that's well-loved because of its powerful features like concurrency and the fact that it is developed by Google.

Golang is a server-side language that's used in many fields like Data Science, Cloud-Native development, game development, and others.

Big companies like Google, Netflix, and Twitch use Golang, which is one of the reasons you should learn it, too.

Here are my top 5 recommended resources for you to learn Golang. If you want to learn more about Go in general, check out this [freeCodeCamp article](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/what-is-go-programming-language/).
