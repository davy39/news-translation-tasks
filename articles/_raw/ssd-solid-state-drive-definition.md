An SSD, or solid state drive, is a type of storage device for computers. They are sometimes called a solid state device or solid state disk, even though they have no moving parts.

Like USB flash drives, SSDs use flash memory to store data. This type of storage means that SSDs are very fast, silent, and resistant to shock.

While SSDs have come down in price, they are still much more expensive and often have lower capacities than HDDs (hard disk drives). 

SSDs are often inside a computer attached to the motherboard. But there are some external SSDs that connect to the computer with a USB cable.

SSDs are a non-volatile type of storage. This means that, unlike RAM, SSDs will retain any data that's written to them, even after the computer is shut down.
