If you've been developing your coding skills so you can work on AI projects, you've probably come across some open source AI resources.

I know I have. In fact, I think I use open source more than I do APIs and proprietary software these days.

When it comes to developing in AI, oftentimes closed source software can be quite restricting because of the company's legal or corporate reasons.

If you've read my [previous](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/langchain-how-to-create-custom-knowledge-chatbots/) [articles](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/create-an-ai-tweet-generator-openai-langchain/) on using LangChain, you already have a fairly good idea of how powerful these open source frameworks can be.

So in this article, I've decided to round up other popular choices that you might find helpful for your AI development needs. Let's dive in.

## First, What is Open Source?

Open source in software development refers to the practice of making the source code of a project available to the public to be used, modified, and redistributed.

With its decentralized nature, it encourages open collaboration and feedback loops that can be significant in helping a project succeed.

Some of the key principles of open-source software development include:

1. **Free Redistribution:** Open-source software should not restrict anyone from selling or giving away the software as part of a software distribution. If it is, no royalty or fee should be required for such distribution.
    
2. **Source Code Availability:** Open-source software must include the source code, which should be easily accessible and distributable. If a software product is not distributed with source code, there should be a well-publicized means of obtaining it.
    
3. **No Discrimination:** Open-source licenses must not discriminate against any individual or group of people, meaning they must be truly accessible by anyone.

This model has been gaining popularity, especially in recent times with sharing platforms such as Twitter and Product Hunt. In fact, 80% of respondents in [a survey](https://blog.opensource.org/the-2023-state-of-open-source-report-confirms-security-as-top-issue/) indicated they increased their use of open source in the past year, of which 41% claimed it was a "significant increase".

## Why Are Open Source AI Projects Important?

There are tons of benefits to open source projects. For the community, open source paves the way for greater transparency, innovation, and community-driven software development.

Whereas for your personal software development journey, there's a variety of reasons to contribute to and use open source projects, such as:

* Getting involved in software development communities that have the same focus areas as you
    
* It allows you to create much more fine-tuned AI models
    
* It's often eye-catching in your portfolio or CV
    
* You get the opportunity to learn from experienced software developers (and possibly find a mentor)
    
* It's a prime avenue for professional networking
    
* It's a great way to grow your reputation and online presence
    
* It helps you improve your personal growth and problem-solving abilities
    

Without open source projects, we would lose a big avenue of growth for the software development community. And we would have to solely rely on working in a tech company in order to gain experience working on large codebases and projects.

With AI techniques and tools growing at such a rapid pace, having open source AI projects allows us to create and train our own AI models or tools, without having to rely on expensive corporate models.

As AI is still blue ocean technology, this means exciting times for software developers who may be the first to create their own apps or tools before the big players.

## My Favorite Open Source AI Projects and Tools

With tons of options and use-cases for open source AI projects out there, I decided to distill them down into 5 main categories. Of course, these projects and tools can be used together (and often are) to create amazing apps and software.

Nevertheless, here are the 5 categories of open source AI projects:

1. Deep Learning Frameworks
    
2. Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Language Models
    
3. Computer Vision and Image Processing
    
4. Machine Learning Libraries and Tools
    
5. AI Assistants and Chatbots
