Do you like listening to music while you code? If so, you're in luck. This blog post is all about music for programming. 

In this reference guide, I'll be sharing a variety of different playlists, radio stations, and videos that you can listen to while coding. Whether you're a beginner or an experienced programmer, you will find something to listen to. 

So put on your headphones and get to work!

## Coding music on Spotify

One of my favorite ways to listen to music while working is through Spotify. If you're not familiar with Spotify, it's a music streaming service that you can use for free (with ads) or for a monthly fee (no ads). 

I like using Spotify because it has a huge selection of songs and albums, and you can create your own playlists. Plus, if you have the paid version, you can download songs and listen to them offline.

If you're looking for some good coding music, here are a few Spotify playlists:

* [Lofi Beats](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/37i9dQZF1DWWQRwui0ExPn?si=29e9d713abbd4a91)
* [Electronic Music for Coding: Fast Programming Instrumentals for Concentration](https://open.spotify.com/album/5oxHFqFU06ufRSZt8izJX6?si=MX_8hXM7SaWYefMFPN_4Ag)
* [Coding Mode](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/37i9dQZF1DX5trt9i14X7j?si=96dcbb8950ab4bbe)
* [Lofi Hip Hop Music - Beats to Relax/Study by Lofi Girl](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/0vvXsWCC9xrXsKd4FyS8kM?si=c615a01d6e4646f6)
* [Deep Focus](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/37i9dQZF1DWZeKCadgRdKQ?si=06a40e58cffc4fdc)
* [Electronic Focus](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/37i9dQZF1DX0wMD4IoQ5aJ?si=16161a1feec54601)
* [House Focus](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/37i9dQZF1DX8wtrGDH81Oa?si=c93d44084cc247bc)

## Music for programming on YouTube

YouTube is another great resource for finding music to listen to while programming. In fact, there are entire channels dedicated to that kind of music.

Here are a few productivity/programming/concentration music channels on YouTube:

* [Chill Music Lab](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCwVQIkAtyZzQSA-OY1rsGig)
* [Filfar](https://www.youtube.com/c/FilFar)
* [Lofi Ghostie](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCDK54OyzWnOczY7LzEd9V2Q/)
* [Lofi Geek](https://www.youtube.com/c/lofigeek/)
* [Lofi Girl](https://www.youtube.com/c/LofiGirl/)
* [Greenred Productions](https://www.youtube.com/c/GreenredProductions/)
* [Productivity Music by Evan Carmichael](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCNl1nMcK1X9EHsW_b5dGzaA/)
* [Fluidified](https://www.youtube.com/c/Fluidified/)

There are also many 24/7 coding music lives. Let me share with you some YouTube queries to find them:

* [24/7 coding](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=24%2F7+coding)
* [24/7 lofi](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=24%2F7+lofi)
* P[rogramming music](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=programming+music&sp=EgJAAQ%3D%3D)
* [Coffee music](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=coffee+music&sp=EgJAAQ%3D%3D)
* [Focus music](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=focus+music&sp=EgJAAQ%3D%3D)

## Music for coding on TwitchTV

TwitchTV is a live streaming video platform where you can watch people play video games, listen to music, and more. There is a lot of great content that you can watch and listen to while coding.

Here are a few music channels on TwitchTV:

* [LeekBeats](https://www.twitch.tv/leekbeats)
* [KuboMusic](https://www.twitch.tv/kubomusic)
* [SixtySevenRadio](https://www.twitch.tv/sixtysevenradio)
* [SpinninRecords](https://www.twitch.tv/spinninrecords)

On this platform, some streamers like to create virtual offices. Most of the time, they are streaming in the ["Just Chatting"](https://www.twitch.tv/directory/game/Just%20Chatting) or ["Software and Game Development"](https://www.twitch.tv/directory/game/Software%20and%20Game%20Development) sections. You can launch their streaming in the background, work with them and listen to good music.

It can be motivating when you're working alone at home and need to have the feeling of working with someone. Some of these streamers are even doing Pomodoro Sessions that you can follow to [get your code done and improve your focus](https://herewecode.io/blog/low-productivity-how-to-stop-wasting-time/).

## Web radio broadcasting music for developers

If you're looking for something a little more low-key, you can try listening to radio dedicated for developers. There are a few stations that play nothing but programming music.

Here are a few of them:

* [Code radio by freeCodeCamp](https://coderadio.freecodecamp.org/)
* [musicForProgramming();](https://musicforprogramming.net/latest/)
* [X-Team Radio](https://radio.x-team.com/)
* [Lofi Cafe](https://www.lofi.cafe/)
