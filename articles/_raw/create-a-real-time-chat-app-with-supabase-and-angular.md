We are just published a course on the freeCodeCamp.org YouTube channel that will help you improve your skills with Supabase and Angular. In this course, you will learn how to build a real-time chat application. The course is perfect for anyone looking to expand their web development skills.

Angular is a popular framework for building web applications. Developed by Google, it allows developers to create dynamic, single-page applications (SPAs) with a clean and efficient architecture. Angular provides a comprehensive solution that includes everything from data binding and dependency injection to routing and state management.

Supabase is an open-source backend-as-a-service platform that helps you build secure and scalable applications. It offers real-time capabilities, a PostgreSQL database, authentication, and storage services. Supabase makes it easy to set up and manage your backend without needing extensive server-side knowledge.

Deji from the Code Angle developed this course. Here are the sections he included in this course.
