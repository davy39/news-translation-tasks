Elementor makes it simple to create a WordPress website using a drag and drop interface. You don't even need any code!

We just published an Elementor course on the freeCodeCamp.org YouTube channel that will teach you how to easily create your own website.

I created this course. I've also made some other popular WordPress courses on the freeCodeCamp.org YouTube channel.

First, you will learn how to get web hosting and register a domain. We use Hostinger for this. Hostinger provided a grant that made this course possible. 

Next, you will learn how to install WordPress, Elementor, and some other helpful plugins.

After everything is set-up, you will learn step-by-step how to create a website using Elementor and Wordpress. The skills you learn in this course can help you create a bunch of different types of websites. 

Here are the sections in this course:
