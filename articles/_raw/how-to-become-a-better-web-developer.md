*Become a better web developer (*[*shahan*](https://www.youtube.com/@ProgrammingwithShahan/featured)*)*

**Web development is divided into three categories:**

* [Frontend developer](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/front-end-developer-what-is-front-end-development-explained-in-plain-english/)  —  you code the frontend of a website and have direct a connection to the user
    
* [Backend developer](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/front-end-developer-vs-back-end-developer-definition-and-meaning-in-practice/)  — you work behind the scenes to make sure the technology that powers the frontend runs smoothly
    
* [Full stack developer](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/what-is-a-full-stack-developer-back-end-front-end-full-stack-engineer/)  —  you know both frontend and backend development
    

## 🎏 How to Become a Better Web Developer

### **Determine your areas of interest**

If you want to become an expert in both front-end and back-end programming, your goal could be to become a full-stack web developer. But if you are more into design and aesthetics, and want to work more directly with clients, the front end might be your niche.

There are a few different approaches you can take to determine your area of interest within web development:

1. **Explore different technologies and frameworks:** One way to get a sense of what you enjoy is to try out different tools and technologies. You can do this by working through tutorials or building small projects with different frameworks, languages, and libraries.
    
2. **Consider your personal interests:** Think about what you enjoy doing in your free time. Are you interested in design? Do you like working with data? Your personal interests can be a great starting point for finding an area of web development that you'll enjoy.
    
3. **Find a project or problem that excites you:** Another approach is to look for a project or problem that you find interesting and try to solve it using web development tools and techniques. This can help you discover what you enjoy working on and what you're good at.
    
4. **Talk to other web developers:** Reach out to other web developers and ask them about their experiences and what they enjoy most about their work. This can give you insight into the different areas of web development and help you identify potential areas of interest.
    
5. **Take online courses or earn a degree:** Finally, consider taking online courses (many are free!) or earning a degree in computer science (if you have the time and resources). This can give you a broad overview of the field and help you identify areas that you find particularly interesting or rewarding.
    

### **Cultivate Curiosity and an Open Mind**

Without curiosity or the desire to learn, you won't be as successful of a web developer as you could otherwise be.

Web development is a challenging field, so it's vital to learn constantly. It's not easy to learn everything you need to know, but if you work hard you'll gradually build up your skills.

An essential trait for any web developer is curiosity, as well as an open mind. Always be open to learning new things and trying them out. The field of web development is constantly evolving, and it's important to stay up-to-date on new technologies and techniques.

In addition, always be willing to consider new ideas and approaches. There may be multiple ways to solve a problem, and being open to different solutions can lead to more creative and effective results. Being fearless about trying things out for yourself is one of the best ways to be open-minded.

### **Don’t Just Write Code – Create Business Value**

A web programmer must write functional lines of code, but that’s not all. In addition, they must go above and beyond the tasks that have been delegated to them. Instead of merely doing what you are told, focus on what your organization requires.

Writing code is an important aspect of web development, but it's not the only aspect. As a web developer, your ultimate goal should be to create business value through the use of technology. This means designing and building websites and applications that solve problems, meet the needs of users, and provide value to the business or organization.

Here are a few ways you can create business value as a web developer:

1. Understand the needs of the business or organization you are working for and design solutions that meet those needs.
    
2. Consider the user experience and make sure the websites and applications you build are easy to use and provide value to the user.
    
3. Build websites and applications that are scalable and able to adapt to changing business needs.
    
4. Utilize data and analytics to make informed decisions about the development of websites and applications.
    
5. Work with cross-functional teams to ensure that the technology you develop aligns with the overall goals and objectives of the business or organization.
    

By focusing on creating business value, you can ensure that the work you do as a web developer is meaningful and impactful.

### **Be Willing to Invest in Yourself**

A good web developer should be well-read. Listen to web development seminars and podcasts, test new plugins and frameworks, use social media responsibly, and be prepared to practice, practice, practice! Hours of diligent practice are required to become an expert and master the craft.

You should also take free courses, read tutorials, and build projects to constantly learn about new trend and ideas. Aside from taking courses, you can attend conferences and meetups and read industry blogs and articles.

Building a strong portfolio is also important for any budding web developer. A strong portfolio of work is essential for showcasing your skills and abilities to potential employers. Make sure to include a variety of projects that demonstrate your capabilities and expertise.

Finally, building relationships with other professionals in the industry can help you learn from others, stay informed about new developments, and potentially open up new job opportunities.

### **Develop Discipline and Dedication to Your Work**

A web developer should be productive, which requires dedication and discipline. Embrace a work culture that makes others want to emulate it. But keep in mind that even though you'll need to work hard, don’t let it interfere too much with your personal and social life. You don't want to get burned out.

On the other side, you must organize your time so that you can be as productive as possible while also having fun. Having a clear understanding of what you want to achieve and how you will go about achieving it can help you stay focused and motivated.

Also, it's important to take breaks and rest to avoid burnout. Consider using the Pomodoro technique, which involves working for a set amount of time, taking a break, and then repeating the process. Having a regular schedule can help you stay on track and ensure that you have dedicated time for web development work.

Finally, seek out opportunities to learn and grow. Dedication to your craft means constantly seeking out opportunities to learn and improve. Attend conferences, workshops, and other events, and make sure to keep up with new technologies and techniques.

### **Help Out with Open Source Projects**

If you're a good web programmer, people will notice and want you to work on their projects. So do your best to build your credibility by contributing to open-source communities like GitHub, Automatic, Angular, Go, and [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/).

### **Finally, Keep your Body and Mind Active**

It is natural for a programmer to spend a significant amount of time in front of a computer. If you want to recharge your batteries and be more effective at work, you should spend time outside doing your favorite athletic activity.

Here are a few ways you can keep your body and mind active as a web developer:

1. **Take breaks and get up and move around:** Sitting for long periods of time can be detrimental to both your physical and mental health. Make sure to take breaks to stretch, walk around, or do some light exercises.
    
2. **Exercise regularly:** Exercise has numerous benefits for both your physical and mental health. Consider incorporating activities such as running, yoga, or strength training into your weekly routine.
    
3. **Get enough sleep:** Adequate sleep is essential for both physical and mental health. Make sure to get at least 7-9 hours of sleep per night to ensure you are well rested and able to perform at your best.
    
4. **Eat a healthy diet:** A healthy diet can help improve your physical and mental well-being. Make sure to incorporate plenty of fruits, vegetables, and other nutritious foods into your meals.
    
5. **Stay hydrated:** Dehydration can lead to physical and mental fatigue. Make sure to drink plenty of water throughout the day to stay hydrated and energized.
    

By taking care of your physical and mental health, you can ensure that you have the energy and focus needed to be productive and successful as a web developer.
