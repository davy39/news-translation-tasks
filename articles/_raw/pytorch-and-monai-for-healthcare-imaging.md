To improve your skills in machine learning and artificial intelligence, it is important to solve real-world problems. What better problem to solve then helping to save people's lives?

Machine learning is being used more and more in the field of healthcare. PyTorch and Monai can be used to discover tumors in livers. 

We just published a course on the freeCodeCamp.org YouTube channel that will teach you how to use PyTorch, Monai, and Python for 3D liver segmentation. You will use machine learning and computer vision to find tumors in livers.

Mohammed El Amine MOKHTARI developed this course. He is a computer vision Ph.D. student and online content creator.

Here are the sections in this course:

* What is U-Net
* Software Installation
* Finding the Datasets
* Preparing the Data
* Installing the Packages
* Preprocessing
* Errors you May Face
* Dice Loss
* Weighted Cross Entropy
* The Training Part
* The Testing Part
* Using the GitHub Repository

Watch the full course below or [on the freeCodeCamp.org YouTube channel](https://youtu.be/M3ZWfamWrBM) (5-hour watch).
