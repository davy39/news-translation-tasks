React state management is a process for managing the data that React components need in order to render themselves. This data is typically stored in the component's state object. When the state object changes, the component will re-render itself.

React state management is basically half of a React app. It includes all the data. The other half is the presentation including the HTML, CSS, and formatting. State and state management is relied on by presentation part of the app. The only time a React app will re-rendered is when state changes.
