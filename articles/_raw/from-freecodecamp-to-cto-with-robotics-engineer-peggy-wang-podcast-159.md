On this week's episode of the podcast, I interview Peggy Wang. She used freeCodeCamp to learn coding. She then worked in Big Tech as a robotics engineer. And now she's cofounder and CTO of Ego AI, a Y-Combinator-backed startup that builds human-like agents for video games.

We talk about:

* How she grew up a first generation American and public school kid in Milwaukee
    
* How her love of robotics helped her get into Stanford
    
* How freeCodeCamp served as a key resource to build her developer chops
    
* The near future of humanoid robots, self-driving cars, and human-like AI agents in games
