The HEIC photo format is Apple’s proprietary version of the HEIF (High-Efficiency Image File) file format. 

It’s a better way to save photos than JPG and JPEG, because with it, you can save up to 50% disk space on your device without losing quality. 

Because HEIC is owned by Apple, photos taken with the latest macOS versions and iOS 11 upward are saved in the .heic format. But it's not readily available on other devices such as Windows and Android. 

So, in this article, I will show you how to convert HEIC files to JPG on a Windows machine.

## How to Convert HEIC to JPG on Windows

**Step 1**: To convert HIEC to JPG on Windows, head over to Microsoft store and search for “HEIC to JPG (FREE)”. It lets you convert 10 HEIC files to JPG in a day.

**Step 2**: Click on the first app that appears in the search results, then “GET” on the next page, and install it.
