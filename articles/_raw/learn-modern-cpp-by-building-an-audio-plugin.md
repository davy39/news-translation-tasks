A lot of C++ courses teach you how to build toy projects with no real-world application. But it can often be more helpful to write programs people would actually use.

We just released a 5-hour C++ course that will teach you how to write modern C++ code by building an audio plugin using the JUCE framework.

This course was developed by Charles Schiermeyer, known as Matkat Music. Not only is Charles an experienced programmer, he is an excellent musician and has been nominated 3 times for a Grammy.

In this course, you will learn how to create an audio plugin that has a 3 band equalizer with a spectrum analyzer at the top. It has a low cut band, high cut band, and parametric band. Don't know what those things are? No problem. You will not only learn about programming, but you will learn a little about music as well.

You will learn how to use the JUCE framework to create the plugin. This is a cross-platform C++ application framework, used for the development of desktop and mobile applications.

Here are the sections covered in this course:

* Setting up the Project
* Creating Audio Parameters 
* Setting up the DSP 
* Setting up Audio Plugin Host 
* Connecting the Peak Params 
* Connecting the LowCut Params 
* Refactoring the DSP
* Adding Sliders to GUI
* Draw the Response Curve
* Build the Response Curve Component
* Customize Slider Visuals
* Response Curve Grid
* Spectrum Analyzer
* Bypass Buttons
