Learn how to code classic video games in this free course from Harvard University.

This course picks up where [Harvard College’s CS50 course](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLWKjhJtqVAbmGw5fN5BQlwuug-8bDmabi) leaves off, focusing on the development of 2D and 3D interactive games. Students explore the design of classic games as Super Mario Bros., Legend of Zelda, and Portal in a quest to understand how video games themselves are implemented.

The course explores principles of 2D and 3D graphics, animation, sound, and collision detection using frameworks like Unity and LÖVE 2D, as well as languages like Lua and C#. By class’s end, students will have programmed several of their own games and gained a thorough understanding of the basics of game design and development.

This full-length university course includes the following 2-hour ad-free lectures:

* Pong (with Lua)
* Flappy Bird (with Lua)
* Breakout (with Lua)
* Match 3 (with Lua)
* Super Mario Bros. Programming Tutorial (with Lua and LOVE2D)
* Legend of Zelda Coding Tutorial (with Lua and LOVE2D)
* Angry Birds Coding Tutorial (with Lua and LOVE2D)
* Pokémon Coding Tutorial (with Lua and LOVE2D)
* Unity / C# Tutorial: Build a 3D Helicopter Game
* Build a Dreadhalls Clone in Unity / C#
* Build a Portal Clone in Unity / C#

And finally, the course instructors will meet with game developers from Valve, the studio behind Portal, Half Life, and many other popular games.

You can watch the full playlist of lectures (and access their sample projects) on the [freeCodeCamp.org YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZqYXSmgDuM&list=PLWKjhJtqVAbluXJKKbCIb4xd7fcRkpzoz) (14 hour watch).
