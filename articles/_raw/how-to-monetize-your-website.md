Web Monetization means that you can get money for every person that visits your website. Sounds good right? But how does it work? 

We just published a course on the freeCodeCamp.org YouTube channel that will teach you how to monetize your website using microtransactions and the Interledger Protocol. 

By the end of this crash course you will know:

* what web monetization is, 
* how to implement it onto your website to get paid for your hard work,
* and how to receive payments.  


Ania Kubow developed this course. She is a software developer and course creator on YouTube, as well as your guide to the world of Web Monetization.

While you will learn about many different monetization strategies, this course focusses on one in particular. You will learn how to make money from your website without having to reply on third party advertisers or selling your users data.

The method involves users, who value the service you offer them from your website, paying you a very small payment for visiting your site.

You will learn how to develop a website where users can choose either an ad-supported version or an ad-free premium experience where they pay a small fee.

Watch the full course below or on [the freeCodeCamp.org YouTube channel](https://youtu.be/XwzcrhhyDkc) (1-hour watch).
