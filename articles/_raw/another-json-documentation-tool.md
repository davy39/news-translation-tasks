There are many JSON structure documentation tool, I have build one more for my office work .[https://jsondoc.online](https://jsondoc.online/)

For me i can classify them in :

# **1. Code decorative tools**

Tools that require to add an annotation in code and then tools generate documentation out it For eg: swagger

# 2. **Declarative tools**

Tools that require to fill text in a particular schema, then tools parse it and generate documentation view. For eg: Json Schema specification

# Why create another tool?

Existing tools requires a strong/clear understanding of what Json represents   
OR  
It assumes that all team member/teams understand the schema to define/edit it.

**But,** in practical I found people sharing request response in google-doc to get approval.   
Google-doc is fine but when I share a proposed response of my service in nested Json format in google-doc ,other teams struggles to understand it, play with it and make an intuited mind model of it.

Hence, created a tool where one can:

1 . Add a JSON structure and share it with a link .  
2. Other team can **play with the Json tree structure.**  
3. A documentation panel where one can view/add documentation.
