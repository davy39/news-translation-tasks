This is the story of the steps I took to get my first job as a **full stack web developer**. I think it’s valuable to share these developer journeys to help others learn about how they can also land their first job as a web developer. I myself drew inspiration from listening to stories of how others got their developer positions. It helped give me ideas on what I should do myself.

#### Why Web Development?

After high school, I decided to study engineering at university because I was good at math and science. I took a couple programming courses in high school. I liked them and briefly considered working towards a computer science degree in university. But I convinced myself to do otherwise since I didn’t think I had done enough work with computers to be able to succeed in such a program.

I didn’t particularly enjoy my university education experience (as I wrote about [here](https://medium.com/@robertcooper_rc/university-needs-to-change-perspective-from-a-new-grad-7121483ff6d)). But I did go through the entire program and ended up getting my engineering degree.

Before my last year of university studies, I was finishing a terribly boring co-op placement. I started looking for alternatives to a post-graduation engineering career. I decided to try and pick up web development since I enjoyed the programming courses I took in university. I was very much interested in the “fun” and “non-traditional” workplaces that are associated with top performing tech companies (e.g. Google, Twitter, Shopify, etc).

#### Shift In Focus

The last 2 years of my engineering degree, I did things that would help position me for a web development role after graduation. I actually considered not completing my final year of studies, but decided to finish since the finish line was in sight. Here is the timeline of the key actions I took:

**January 2016**

I started taking some [**online web development courses**](https://teamtreehouse.com), of which there are no shortage of resources on the internet. I built a website for myself and then decided that I wanted to build websites for others so I could get more practice.

**April 2016**

I ended up participating in a government program that gave funding to students to start their own business. I **started my own web development business** during a summer and had 5 clients total. I learned a lot about web development as well as what it takes to run a small business. I was building websites using _WordPress_ and _Shopify_.

_My business was called “Quark Designs”. The business name was inspired by the elementary particles called [“quarks”](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quark" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="), which is a physics-related thing._

**September 2016**

During my last year at university, I had a lot of stuff going on. I shut down my web development business and opted to **work as a developer for a business consulting startup**. I was responsible for the development of client websites. I was using the same platform to build websites as I had used for my own business (_WordPress_ and _Shopify_).

I applied to participate in the organizing committee of a large student-run technology conference. I ended up with the position of **director of technology**. I was responsible for building out the conference’s website along with another student developer. The website was built with basic _HTML_, _CSS_, and _JavaScript_

I also **joined my university’s engineering society IT team.** I got to work on a project that used a lot more _JavaScript_ than anything else I had previously worked with. The team dynamic wasn’t very good. But I learned a lot about working with others through the process. I carry those lessons learned with me when working on any sort of collaborative project.

Furthermore, I volunteered as a mentor for multiple workshops run by two local organizations. These organizations provided workshops to teach members of the community how to learn to code. I volunteered at around half a dozen workshops in the span of a year starting in September. Mentoring not only gave me the opportunity to help others. It also gave me confidence in the web development knowledge I had along as well as further reinforcing of web development concepts.

**December 2016**

Though not necessarily developer related, I became the **chair of a [young professional networking organization](https://www.kingstonyoungprofessionals.com/)**. This helped me make a lot of connections in the community and also made me more comfortable speaking to new people. Some of the skills I picked up from this experience have helped me during job interviews.

**April 2017**

I **graduated from university** with a Mechanical Engineering degree. I then transitioned to **working full-time** at the same business consulting startup I started working with in September.

**July 2017**

I got **let go from my job**. I wasn’t given any reason for the decision which was a bummer, since I always want to learn from my mistakes. However, this ended up being good for me since the kind of developer work I was doing wasn’t what I ultimately wanted to be doing. I was doing simple _WordPress_ and _Shopify_ websites which weren’t challenging me as a developer. What I really wanted to be doing was create unique web applications that solved specific client needs.

Being let go also **ignited a fire in me**. While working full-time, I wasn’t prioritizing learning. So I wasn’t positioning myself to land a developer job that worked on solving interesting problems using flexible tech stacks. The week after I was let go, I doubled down in my learning efforts. I started working away on lots of side projects. I was writing blog articles, reading/watching tutorials, and participating in developer meetups. I also started giving talks to groups of developers on web development technologies.

_You can see that my Github contributions spiked shortly after the end of my full-time job.I was working away on lots of open source side projects._

#### Job Hunt

The hunt for a web developer job that I truly desired lasted from August 2017 to December 2017 (**5 months**). I was applying to many different web development companies that were located in large cities. I wanted to move to a larger city since I wanted to be part of a more vibrant tech community. Also I believe there are more opportunities for career growth in larger cities.

Not sure how many applications I ended up sending up, but I ended up with **5 interviews**. I had one interview that went extremely well. The company’s HR person had me convinced I had the job, but then something happened and I was told the company went into a “hiring freeze.”

This sucked since I had already told a bunch of people that it looked like I was likely going to work for the company. This experience taught me to keep my mouth shut about all future interviews. I reserved making any sort of announcements before I had received a formal job offer and signed some official paperwork.

I had another interview with for a job that would have been in Amsterdam. I was really excited about since I had visited the city the previous summer and really liked it. Unfortunately, I kind of bombed the coding challenge, which I described [here](https://medium.com/@robertcooper_rc/an-newsletter-sign-up-form-that-cost-me-a-job-b4dc501203df)

#### Job Offer

I was working a lot on side projects involving React since it was part of a lot of job posting requirements. One company I applied for sent me a coding challenge that had me build out a small login and user dashboard application using React. I was given around a week to complete the challenge and I went ALL OUT. I was spending **6–8 hours a day working on the challenge** and had a friend of mine do a code review where he suggested improvements to my app.

After submitting my solution to the coding challenge, I was asked to participate in a video interview with some of the team members at the company. I would call my interview more of a conversation since it was really me talking about my past experience. It was also a chance for their team to get a sense of my personality and interests. I had a good vibe from the experience, but I am also a terrible judge of how my interviews turn out. The interview was on a Tuesday and I **received an offer for employment** at the end of the day on Friday for a position as a full stack web developer at [Osedea](https://osedea.com/en). Of course, I accepted the offer

_Full Stack Web Developer baby!_

I’ve been at my newest job for a little over a month now and couldn’t be happier with where I am. I’m **learning a ton** by working on projects that use React, React Native, and Laravel. The company encourages everyone to take time to **stay up to date with latest technology** trends. I’m being exposed to a bunch of new stuff on a daily basis and I’m **growing as a web developer** at an extremely fast pace.

I hope this article helps inspire some people to pursue a web development career. It may also provide some ideas on how best to approach getting a job as a web developer. Feel free to reach out for any more details or advice!
