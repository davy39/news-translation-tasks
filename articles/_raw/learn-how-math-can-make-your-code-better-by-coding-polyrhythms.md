Are you someone who’s wondered if math really matters when writing code? Or perhaps you've struggled to keep your code clean and understandable while working on fun projects? This course might just change your perspective! Understanding math concepts can simplify your code, make it more efficient, and help reduce pesky bugs. Plus, it's a great way to improve your overall coding skills in an engaging and practical way.

We just published a course on the [freeCodeCamp.org](http://freeCodeCamp.org) YouTube channel where Dr. Radu Mariescu-Istodor teaches you how to code polyrhythms in JavaScript. This course emphasizes good coding practices and shows how math can help you write cleaner, more maintainable code. By applying mathematical concepts, you’ll simplify your logic and reduce complexity while working on a fun and creative project. If you've ever been curious about how rhythm and programming intersect, this course is a perfect starting point.

In this project-based course, you’ll learn how to generate procedural sounds and visualize complex polyrhythmic patterns using JavaScript. You’ll explore how to structure your code for readability and maintainability while seeing how math underpins these concepts. This project highlights how math can make tricky coding challenges much easier to solve — even ones that seem as intricate as overlapping musical rhythms!

If you've ever doubted the usefulness of math in programming, this course will dispel that myth. You'll gain a deeper appreciation for how math can simplify your code and help you create more sophisticated projects. By the end, you'll not only have an exciting interactive project to showcase but also a stronger grasp of how mathematical thinking can elevate your programming skills.

Watch the full course on the freeCodeCamp.org YouTube channel (1-hour watch).
