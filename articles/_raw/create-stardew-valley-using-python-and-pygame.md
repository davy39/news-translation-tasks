Stardew Valley is a popular open-ended country-life RPG video game. But instead of just playing the game, why not code your own version of the game?

We just published a full course on the freeCodeCamp.org YouTube channel that will teach you how to create a Stardew Valley game clone using Python and Pygame.

The game you will create has features such as farming, foraging, a day and night cycle, weather effects, a merchant, and more. And part of the game is made using the Tiled map editor which makes it easy to expand the game.

Christian from Clear Code created this game. Christian is a popular instructor who has taught millions of people game development with Python.

Here are the sections covered in this course:

* Setup
* Creating the basic player
* Importing the player graphics
* Animating the player
* Tool use
* Switching between tools
* Creating the overlay
* Starting the camera and importing the floor
* Importing all elements and faking more 3D
* Collisions
* Working on the trees
* Particles
* Player inventory
* Restarting the day
* Starting the soil
* Soil patch graphics
* Watering logic
* Rain
* Creating the plants
* Harvesting
* Daytime transition
* The merchant
* Audio
