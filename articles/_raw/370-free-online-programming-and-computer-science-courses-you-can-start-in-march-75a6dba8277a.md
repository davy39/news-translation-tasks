### Thought of the day:

> “It ain’t what you don’t know that gets you into trouble. It’s what you know for sure that just ain’t so.” — Mark Twain

### Image of the day:

A normal credit card payment terminal on the left, a credit card skimmer on the right. These skimmers are planted within stores by thieves and used to steal credit card information — [sometimes for weeks without being detected](http://bit.ly/2m8hWsM).
