On this week's episode of the freeCodeCamp Podcast, I interview hardware engineer and tech founder from Austria.

We talk about growing up in the European countryside, his early passion for computers, and ultimately his move to San Francisco, where he's founded several tech companies.

Bruno's super excited about embedded systems and custom hardware. He's building home appliances that incorporate open source software and open datasets.

We cover so many topics here. From Star Trek to the European Pirate Party.

I hope these weekly freeCodeCamp podcasts are firing you up about learning more about technology.
