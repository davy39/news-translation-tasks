We just published a new course on the freeCodeCamp.org YouTube channel that mixes computer vision, deep learning, and Arduino into some really fun projects.

In this course, you’ll build two hands-on applications using MediaPipe and OpenCV. The first project shows you how to control an LCD display with your facial movements. The second project takes things further by using computer vision to control a robotic arm.

Along the way, you’ll learn how to:

* Set up serial communication between Python and Arduino
    
* Use MediaPipe’s face detection and landmarks module
    
* Work with LCD displays and servo motors
    
* Apply image processing techniques with OpenCV
    

The instructor, Yılmaz ALACA, walks you through the process step by step and explains the hardware and software in a clear way.

You can watch the full course [on the freeCodeCamp.org YouTube channel](https://youtu.be/Q5U-b6gRTaY) (3-hour watch).
