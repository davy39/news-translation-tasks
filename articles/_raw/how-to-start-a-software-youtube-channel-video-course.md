In this YouTube video course, I share everything you need to know to start your own successful software YouTube channel.

For some context - freeCodeCamp has experimented with YouTube for the past 5 years, and really started to get traction within the past 18 months.

I'll share what we have found works, insights about YouTube's algorithms, and practical tips.

The course covers:

* how to get started on YouTube
* tips for planning and recording videos
* how to make good thumbnails and titles
* what the algorithm cares about
* how to get views
* how to make money
* and much more.

You will also hear tips from these successful YouTube creators: The Tech Lead, Brad Traversy, CodingPhase, RealToughCandy, Jesse Weigel, Caleb Curry, and Kevin Markham.

You can watch the [full video course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsTagX5tG4E) on the freeCodeCamp.org YouTube channel (1 hour watch).
