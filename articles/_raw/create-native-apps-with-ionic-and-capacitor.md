Ionic and Capacitor are two powerful tools that can be used to build native mobile applications. Ionic is a UI framework that provides a wide range of components and features for building mobile apps, while Capacitor is a runtime that allows Ionic apps to be deployed to both iOS and Android devices.

We just posted a course on the freeCodeCamp YouTube channel that will teach you everything you need to know to build native mobile apps with Ionic and Capacitor. You'll learn about the basics of Ionic, how to create your own components, and how to use Capacitor to deploy your apps to the App Store and Google Play.

By the end of this course, you'll be able to build native mobile apps that look and feel great on both iOS and Android devices. You'll also have the skills you need to build more complex and feature-rich apps.
