Low-Code can allow you to spin up apps fast and with out-of-the-box UI components.

We just released a course on the freeCodeCamp.org YouTube channel that will teach you about Low-Code solutions by building 3 financial apps. 

Ania Kubów developed this course. She is a ex-financial Broker turned software developer.

Think of low-code platforms as app builders that essentially give you all the UI components you need and also give you the option to integrate them using pre-configured inputs for APIs.

This type of solution is perfect for personal trackers on your finances, in-house apps that need to be spun up quickly, or perhaps Proof of Concept prototypes looking for investment. 

The first app you will build is a trade dashboard for brokers to log their trades as well as track their commissions. The app also communicates with their back offices with an integrated message sender thanks to Slack API.

The second app is a Crypto Dashboard using CoinAPI’s service to get live prices. It also utilizes Twillio’s API to send text messages to your friends or family about any changes you see instantly.

The final app is an invoice tracker that communicates with an external database using the GraphQL API. It allows you to embed instructional videos for those using it.  


The course covers:

* Low-Code VS No-Code
* Use Cases
* Setting up Retool
* Compatible Integrations
* Building a Trade Dashboard
* Building a Crypto Dashboard
* Building an Invoice Tracker
* And of course, where to go next

Retool provided a grant to make this course possible. Learn more at [https://retool.com](https://retool.com/).
