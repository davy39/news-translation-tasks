If you're using Microsoft Word, you don't want blank pages appearing in the middle of your document, or extra pages at the end. 

These extra pages could be caused by tables, hitting the `ENTER` key too many times, unnecessary section breaks, unintentional page breaks, extra paragraph markers, and more.

You don’t want your Word document to look unprofessional because of this quirk, so in this article I'll show you how to delete blank and extra pages in Word.

I will be using Microsoft Office 2016 in this tutorial, but you can follow along with any version, as pretty much the same thing applies to all versions.

## How to Delete a Blank Page in the Middle of a Word Document

If you are working with a large word document and you are about to present it or print it, it’s a good idea to check for blank pages and an extra final page. 

To do this, press `CTRL` + `SHIFT` + `8`, or go to the Home tab and click the paragraph icon.

This key combination displays paragraph markers (¶) at the end of every paragraph and each blank line – basically, whenever you hit the `ENTER` key, and at the beginning of the extra blank page.

To remove these extra pages, highlight the paragraph markers with your mouse or trackpad and hit the `DELETE` button. If one of the markers remains there, remove it with the `BACKSPACE` key.

If you have the patience, you can also remove the blank page(s) by going to the blank pages and hitting the `BACKSPACE` key until the paragraph markers disappear.

## How to Delete an Extra Blank Page in a Word Document

**Step 1**: To delete an extra blank page that might get added at the end of your document, click the `View` tab:

**Step 2**: Go to the Navigation Pane. This will display a sidebar containing 3 tabs – `Headings`, `Pages`, and `Results`. Click on `Pages` to display all the pages of the document in the sidebar.

**Step 3**: The active page will be automatically selected. Click the extra blank page to select it and hit the `DELETE` button on your keyboard to remove it.
