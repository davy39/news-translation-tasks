Learn how to build a blockchain app using Ethereum smart contracts in this video course from Dapp University. A smart contract is a collection of code and data that resides at a specific address on the Ethereum blockchain.

You will learn how to create a todo app with Ethereum smart contracts using the Solidity programming language. You will also learn to write tests, deploy to the blockchain, and create a client-side application.

You can watch the full video course on the [freeCodeCamp.org YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=coQ5dg8wM2o) (1.5 hour watch).
