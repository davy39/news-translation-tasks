[Peppermint OS](https://peppermintos.com/) is a lightweight Linux distro designed for older PCs and laptops. If your aging hardware is struggling under the weight of Windows or macOS, Peppermint could give it a new lease on life.

Here are some of its features:

### Light on Resources

Peppermint OS uses the [LXDE](http://lxde.org/) desktop environment that’s optimized for older CPUs and limited memory. It only needs 512MB of RAM to run, so it will fly on that Pentium 4 machine or Core 2 Duo laptop you have stashed in your closet. 

The OS takes up about 3GB of storage. This keeps your system resources focused on the tasks that matter to you.

### Cloud Support 

While Peppermint OS is light on local resources, it integrates well with cloud and web apps. The OS builds in close integration with services like Dropbox, Google Drive, and more. 

You can save files directly to and open files from these cloud services. This means you have access to lots of functionality without needing high-powered local software.

### User-Friendly

Don’t worry if you’re not a Linux expert, Peppermint OS is designed to be easy to use. The menu is simple to navigate, and installing software is straightforward. 

The distro is also compatible with lots of Windows programs, so you may be able to use some of the same software you’re familiar with.

The best part is that [Peppermint OS](https://peppermintos.com/) is free to download and try. You can install it on your aging PC to give it a boost and see how it runs without committing to anything. If you find it’s not for you, you can simply uninstall it and you’re back to where you started. 

For a PC that’s losing its charm, Peppermint OS could be just the refresh it needs. Why not give it a go?

AntiX also has its own lightweight system tools for things like managing users, networks, and services.

You should know these before using the AntiX distro:

* AntiX is based on [Debian](https://www.debian.org/), so the package management and repositories will feel familiar to most Linux users.
* The AntiX ISO is under 700MB, so it’s quick to download and install.
* AntiX is highly configurable. You can easily add and remove components to suit your needs.
* AntiX releases are rolling, so you get continuous updates without needing to install a new version.

AntiX is ideal if you want to give new life to that old PC collecting dust in your closet. It will run smoothly on systems that struggle with Windows and most mainstream Linux distributions. The minimal requirements mean it can work with nearly any x86 computer from the last 20 years.

Despite its lightweight nature, [AntiX](https://antixlinux.com/) provides a complete desktop experience with office tools, internet apps, multimedia players, and more.
