String manipulation is a common task for programmers, whether it is extracting information from the string, converting letter cases, joining strings, or trimming extra white spaces.

This tutorial covers various methods and techniques for manipulating strings using JavaScript, offering you a comprehensive guide on how to work with strings in your JavaScript applications.

## **How to Extract a Character from a String in JavaScript**

Let's start by talking about how to extract a single character from a string. JavaScript offers three different methods for this purpose: `charAt()`, `at()`, and `charCodeAt()`.

### How to Use `charAt(index)`

The `charAt()` method accepts an index, and returns the character at that index.

```javascript
const str = "Hello World!";

console.log(str.charAt(0));
console.log(str.charAt(8));
console.log(str.charAt(16));
```

```text
H
r


```

If the index is out of range, `charAt()` will return an empty string (`""`).

### How to Use `at(index)`

The `at()` method was added to JavaScript with ES2022, and it is very similar to `charAt()`. You pass it an index, and the method returns the character at that index.

```javascript
const str = "Hello World!";

console.log(str.at(0));
console.log(str.at(8));
console.log(str.at(16));
```

```text
H
r
undefined
```

When the index is out of range, `at()` will return `undefined` instead of an empty string.

Another difference is that `at()` allows for negative indexing, meaning index `-1` returns the last character of the string, `-2` returns the second last character, and so on.

```javascript
const str = "Hello World!";

console.log(str.at(-1));
console.log(str.at(-2));
```

```text
!
d
```

Before `at()`, the only way to do this was through the `length` property.

```javascript
const str = "Hello World!";

console.log(str.charAt(str.length - 1)); // The last character
console.log(str.charAt(str.length - 2)); // The second last character
```

```text
!
d
```

### How to Use `charCodeAt(index)`

The `charCodeAt()` method returns the [UTF-16](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTF-16) code of the character at the specified index.

```javascript
const str = "Hello World!";

console.log(str.charCodeAt(0));
console.log(str.charCodeAt(4));
```

```text
72
111
```

## **How to Extract a Substring in JavaScript**

Besides extracting a single character, JavaScript also allows you to extract a substring using methods `substring()` and `slice()`.

### How to Use `substring(start, end)`

`substring()` extracts a substring based on the provided `start` (inclusive) and `end` (exclusive) indexes, and returns the substring as a new string.

```javascript
const str = "JavaScript";

console.log(str.substring(0, 4));
```

```text
Java
```

The `end` index can be left out, in which case the substring will be extracted from `start` to the end of the string.

```javascript
const str = "JavaScript";

console.log(str.substring(4));
```

```text
Script
```

### How to Use `slice(start, end)`

`slice()` is very similar to `substring()`. It also extracts a substring based on the provided `start` and `end` indexes, and returns the substring as a new string.

```javascript
const str = "JavaScript";

console.log(str.slice(0, 4));
```

```text
Java
```

The `end` index can also be omitted.

```javascript
const str = "JavaScript";

console.log(str.slice(4));
```

```text
Script
```

The difference is that `slice()` accepts negative indexes. For example, the following example extracts the substring from index `-10` to `-6`.

```javascript
const str = "JavaScript";

console.log(str.slice(-10, -6));
```

```text
Java
```

## **How to Convert a String to Upper or Lower Case in JavaScript**

The methods `toUpperCase()` and `toLowerCase()` convert the string to upper or lower case.

```javascript
const str = "JavaScript";

console.log(str.toUpperCase());
console.log(str.toLowerCase());
```

```text
JAVASCRIPT
javascript
```

## **How to Join Two Strings Together in JavaScript**

The easiest way to join two strings together is using the `+` operator:

```javascript
const str1 = "Hello";
const str2 = "World!";

const str3 = str1 + " " + str2;

console.log(str3);
```

```text
Hello World!
```

Alternatively, you can use the `concat()` method:

```javascript
const str1 = "Hello";
const str2 = "World!";

const str3 = str1.concat(" ", str2);

console.log(str3);
```

```text
Hello World!
```

Or you can use [template literals](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/template-literals-in-javascript/):

```javascript
const str1 = "Hello";
const str2 = "World!";

const str3 = `${str1} ${str2}`;

console.log(str3);
```

```text
Hello World!
```

## **How to Trim Extra White Spaces from a String in JavaScript**

When working with strings that came from external sources, such as parsed from a webpage or received from user input, a common problem you might encounter is the leading and trailing white spaces.

JavaScript offers three different methods that allow you to easily remove the extra white spaces and keep only the useful information.

The `trimStart()` method removes the leading white spaces, including spaces, tabs, and line breaks. The `trimEnd()` method removes trailing white spaces, and `trim()` removes white spaces from both ends.

```javascript
const str = "  \n\tHello World!\t\n  ";

console.log(str.trimStart());
console.log(str.trimEnd());
console.log(str.trim());
```

```text
Hello World!


 Hello World!
Hello World!
```

## **How to Add Padding to a String in JavaScript**

The methods `padStart()` and `padEnd()` can be used to pad characters or substrings at the beginning or the end of the original string.

Both methods take two arguments, `length` and a substring. The substring will be repeated multiple times, until the resulting string reaches the target length.

```javascript
const str = "123";

console.log(str.padStart(5, "0"));
console.log(str.padEnd(5, "0"));
```

```text
00123
12300
```

If the substring is causing the resulting string to exceed the target length, then only a part of that substring will be used.

```javascript
const str = "123";

console.log(str.padStart(8, "ok"));
```

```text
okoko123
```

Notice that the substring `"ok"` is repeated twice, but for the third time, it causes the resulting string to exceed the length limit, so only `"o"` is used for the final padding.

## **How to Repeat a String in JavaScript**

`repeat()` returns a new string, with the specified number of copies of the original string.

```javascript
const str = "123";

console.log(str.repeat(3));
```

```text
123123123
```

## **How to Split String into an Array in JavaScript**

The `split()` method splits the string based on the given character, and returns the result in an array. This method is most useful when you need to extract information from a URL. 

For example, this is how you can extract the slug of a blog post:

```javascript
const url = "http://www.example.com/blog/example-article";

let arr = url.split("/");
console.log(arr);

let slug = arr[4];
console.log(slug);
```

```text
[ 'http:', '', 'www.example.com', 'blog', 'example-article' ]
example-article
```

## **How to Search in a String in JavaScript**

You can also search for a character or substring using JavaScript.

### How to Use `indexOf()` and `lastIndexOf()`

The `indexOf()` method returns the index of the **first** occurrence of the given character.

The `lastIndexOf()` methods returns the index of the **last** occurrence of the given character.

```javascript
const str = "Hello World";

console.log(str.indexOf("l"));
console.log(str.lastIndexOf("l"));
```

```text
2
9
```

Both methods will return -1 if a match is not found.

```javascript
const str = "Hello World";

console.log(str.indexOf("x"));
console.log(str.lastIndexOf("x"));
```

```text
-1
-1
```

### How to Use `includes()`

The `includes()` method tests if the string contains the given character or substring. It returns `true` if the substring is found, otherwise `false` will be returned.

```javascript
const str = "JavaScript";

console.log(str.includes("S"));
console.log(str.includes("Script"));
console.log(str.includes("script"));
```

```text
true
true
false
```

### How to Use `startsWith()` and `endsWith()`

As the names suggest, these two methods test if the given substring is found at the beginning or the end of the string.

```javascript
const str = "JavaScript";

console.log(str.startsWith("Java"));
console.log(str.endsWith("Java"));

console.log(str.startsWith("Script"));
console.log(str.endsWith("Script"));
```

```text
true
false
false
true
```

## **How to Search in a String using Regex in JavaScript**

But what if you need something more powerful? For example, the `indexOf()` and `lastIndexOf()` methods only return the first and last occurrences of the substring, but what if you need to search for all of them?

Or what if, instead of a substring, you need to search for a pattern, such as a phone number or a price tag?

This can be achieved by combining the string methods with [Regex](https://www.thedevspace.io/course/javascript-regular-expressions), which stands for regular expression. It is a programming tool that allows you to describe patterns in a string. Regex has a very cryptic syntax, but can be very useful sometimes.

### How to Use `search()`

The `search()` method works similarly to `indexOf()` we just discussed. It also returns the **first** occurrence of the matched substring or pattern, except that `search()` allows you to pass a regular expression.

The following example, `/(?<=\$)\d\d?\d?\d?/`, searches for a price tag in the string, which should start with a dollar sign (`$`), and be followed by 1 to 4 numeric digits.

```javascript
const str = "The laptop costs $1500. The tablet costs $1000.";

console.log(str.search("1500"));
console.log(str.search(/(?<=\$)\d\d?\d?\d?/));
console.log(str.search(/(?<=\$)\d\d?\d?\d?/g));
```

```text
18
18
18
```

Notice that the global flag (`g`) has no effect on `search()`, and it still returns the first occurrence of the match.

### How to Use `match()` and `matchAll()`

Compared to `search()`, the `match()` method returns much more information that you can work with, such as the actual substring that matches the pattern, the index where the match is found, and more.

```javascript
const str = "The laptop costs $1500. The tablet costs $1000.";

console.log(str.match(/(?<=\$)\d\d?\d?\d?/));
console.log(str.match(/(?<=\$)\d\d?\d?\d?/g));
```

```text
[
 '1500',
 index: 18,
 input: 'The laptop costs $1500. The tablet costs $1000.',
 groups: undefined
]
[ '1500', '1000' ]
```

By including a global flag, you can make `match()` return all matched substrings, instead of just the first one.

There is also a `matchAll()` method that forces you to use the global flag. Without it, the method will return a `TypeError`.

`matchAll()` will return an [iterable object](https://www.thedevspace.io/course/javascript-objects#iterating-over-an-object), which you can iterate over using a `for of` loop.

```javascript
const str = "This laptop costs $1500. The tablet costs $1000.";

const prices = str.matchAll(/(?<=\$)\d\d\d\d/g);

for (let price of prices) {
  console.log(price);
}
```

```text
[
 '1500',
 index: 19,
 input: 'This laptop costs $1500. The tablet costs $1000.',
 groups: undefined
]
[
 '1000',
 index: 43,
 input: 'This laptop costs $1500. The tablet costs $1000.',
 groups: undefined
]
```

## **How to Replace a String Pattern in JavaScript**

Lastly, the `replace()` method allows you to match for a pattern, and then replace the matched substrings with a new string. For example:

```javascript
const str = "JavaScript javaScript Javascript";

console.log(str.replace(/JAVASCRIPT/i, "javascript"));
console.log(str.replace(/JAVASCRIPT/gi, "javascript"));
```

```text
javascript javaScript Javascript
javascript javascript javascript
```

By default, `replace()` only matches and replaces the first occurrence of the pattern, but with the global flag, you can replace all matched patterns.

## **Conclusion**

In this tutorial, we explored various methods you can use to work with strings in JavaScript. We also covered how to use regular expressions to match for string patterns.

As a brief summary, here are the methods we discussed in this tutorial:

* `charAt(index)`: Extracts the character at the specified index from a string.
* `at(index)`: Retrieves the character at the specified index, supports negative indexing.
* `charCodeAt(index)`: Returns the UTF-16 code of the character at the specified index.
* `substring(start, end)`: Extracts a part of the string between the start (inclusive) and end indexes (exclusive).
* `slice(start, end)`: Similar to `substring()`, extracts a part of the string between start (inclusive) and end indexes (exclusive), but supports negative indexing.
* `toUpperCase()`: Converts all letters in the string to uppercase.
* `toLowerCase()`: Converts all letters in the string to lowercase.
* `concat()`: Joins two or more strings together.
* `trimStart()`: Removes whitespace from the beginning of a string. Including spaces, tabs, and newlines.
* `trimEnd()`: Removes whitespace from the end of a string.
* `trim()`: Removes whitespace from both ends of a string.
* `padStart(length, substring)`: Pads the start of a string with another string (multiple times, if needed) until the resulting string reaches the given length.
* `padEnd(length, substring)`: Pads the end of the string with another string (multiple times, if needed) until the resulting string reaches the given length.
* `repeat(count)`: Returns a new string which contains the specified number of copies of the original string.
* `split(separator)`: Splits the string into an array of substrings, using the specified separator to determine where to make the split.
* `indexOf(searchValue)`: Returns the index of the first occurrence of the specified substring. Returns -1 if not found.
* `lastIndexOf(searchValue)`: Returns the index of the last occurrence of the specified substring. Returns -1 if not found.

* `startsWith(searchValue)`: Checks if the string begins with the specified substring.
* `endsWith(searchValue)`: Checks if the string ends with the specified substring.
* `search(regexp)`: Search for a string pattern, which could be defined by a Regex. Returns the index of the first occurrence of the match or -1 if not found.
* `match(regexp)`: Search for a string pattern, which is defined by a Regex. If a global flag is included, it will return all occurrences of the pattern.
* `matchAll(regexp)`: Returns an iterable object containing all results matching a string against a global regular expression.
