Passing the AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner Exam is one of the first steps to a career in cloud development. And freeCodeCamp just published a free 14-hour course that will help you prepare for the exam. 

This exam mostly deals with cloud computing concepts. Even if you are new to coding, you should be able to prepare for this exam and earn the AWS certification. Andrew Brown created this course. He is a popular instructor and the CEO of ExamPro.

## What is the AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner?

The Certified Cloud Practitioner is the **entry-level AWS certification** that goes through:

* The cloud fundamentals, for example Cloud Concepts, Cloud Architecture, and Cloud Deployment Models
* A close look at the AWS Core Services
* A quick look at the vast amount of AWS services
* Identity, Security, and Governance of the Cloud
* Billing, Pricing, and Support of AWS Services

The course code is **CLF-C02** but its commonly referred to as the **CCP**.

Amazon Web Services is the leading Cloud Service Provider (CSP) in the world and the AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner **is the most common starting point** for people breaking into the cloud industry.

Consider the AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner if:

* You are **new to cloud** and need to learn the fundamentals
* You are in the **executive, management, or sales level** and need to acquire strategic information about cloud for adoption or migration
* You are a Senior Cloud Engineer or Solutions Architect who needs to **reset or refresh** your AWS knowledge after working for multiple years

No matter your path towards a cloud role, the AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner provides fundamental knowledge that you shouldn't skip.

Here are all the sections in this comprehensive course:
