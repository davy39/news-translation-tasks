This week we live-stream the 2020 Reactathon – a 3-day React conference – for free on freeCodeCamp's YouTube channel.

Reactathon (also known as the San Francisco React Conference) usually takes place in downtown San Francisco in March. You can probably guess why they postponed it this year. (It starts with P-A-N-D and doesn't eat bamboo.)

The good news is the conference was fully online, and you can watch all the talks right now, safe from the comfort of your own home.

Note that for each conference talk listed below, I've included the introduction segment by conference MCs [Anjana Vakil](https://twitter.com/AnjanaVakil) and [Jonathan Cutrell](https://twitter.com/jcutrell). These are no ordinary MCs – they are both icons of the software development field.

Jonathan is best known as the host of the popular [Developer Tea podcast](https://spec.fm/podcasts/developer-tea). And Anjana has given a number of particularly influential conference talks on JavaScript-related topics, [like this one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo0qiGPSV-s).

## Reactathon 2020 Day 1 Talks

### Guillermo Rauch talk on Next.js

Day 1 started off with a keynote from Guillermo Rauch, founder of Vercel (formerly Zeit) and co-creator of the popular Next.js full stack development framework.

Guillermo is one of the most exciting figures in JavaScript at the moment, and I think you'll dig his keynote. 

[You can watch Guillermo's talk here](https://youtu.be/KgTW0xfyr9A?t=3304).

### Lydia Hallie talk on JavaScript V8

Then Lydia Hallie walked everyone through how the JavaScript V8 engine works. It was a heavily visual explanation of this cornerstone of Chrome, Node.js, and much of high-performance JavaScript.

[You can watch Lydia's talk here](https://youtu.be/KgTW0xfyr9A?t=5418).

### Swizec Teller talk on Authentication

Next, Swizec Teller showed everyone how to add authentication to any React app in 5 minutes using Auth0.

[You can watch Swizec's talk here](https://youtu.be/KgTW0xfyr9A?t=6151).

### Alex Krolic talk on Async React Testing

Alex Krolick then showed everyone how to test asynchronous React components using the React Testing Library.

[You can watch Alex's talk here](https://youtu.be/KgTW0xfyr9A?t=7466).

### Bryan Manuele talk on Static Analysis in React

Bryan Manuele showed everyone how to use Static Analysis to quantify the health of their React Codebases.

[You can watch Bryan's talk here](https://youtu.be/KgTW0xfyr9A?t=8345).

### Jana Beck talk on Dimensionality Reduction in React

Jana Beck showcased some advanced Data Science in the browser. She used Web Workers and OffscreenCanvas to perform Dimensionality Reduction in the browser. This way, you can look at multi-dimensional data visually, in a way humans can more easily understand. It was a lot of fun.

[You can watch Jana's talk here](https://youtu.be/KgTW0xfyr9A?t=15588).

### Shawn Wang (Swyx) talk on Type-safe Full Stack React

We closed out day 1 with a talk from freeCodeCamp local hero Shawn Wang (Swyx) about type-safe full stack React. That's right – static typing on both the front end and back end.

The benefits of Shawn's approach: better warnings (and thus, better developer experience) and fewer errors.

He even live-coded a TypeScript + React + GraphQL app live to showcase this approach. Live coding. What can go wrong? A lot, but Shawn is a pro. He's always a blast to watch in action.

[You can watch Shawn's talk here](https://youtu.be/KgTW0xfyr9A?t=17107).

## Reactathon 2020 Day 2 Talks

### Kent C. Dodds talk on React Application State Management

Kent C. Dodds kicked off Day 2 with a keynote about React Application State Management. He showed how to organize your app to avoid maintenance headaches down the road.

Kent also gave some tips for how to increase performance just by being more thoughtful in how you categorize your app.

[You can watch Kent's talk here](https://youtu.be/pkNzU-5oDiA?t=3629).

### Tejas Kumar talk on React as a Component Abstraction Layer

Next, Tejas Kumar took a look at how developers use React as a sort of Component Abstraction Layer. He gave everyone a peek under the hood and see what exactly makes React React.

[You can watch 's Tejas's talk here](https://youtu.be/pkNzU-5oDiA?t=5792).

### Daria Caraway talk on writing highly readable React Component APIs in Typescript

Then Daria Caraway shared tips for writing highly readable – or "considerate" as she likes to call it – React component APIs using TypeScript.

[You can watch Daria's talk here](https://youtu.be/pkNzU-5oDiA?t=7394).

### Quincy Larson interview (oh hey, that's me, the author of this article)

At this point, Anjana and Jonathan interviewed me for about 10 minutes about freeCodeCamp, its history, and our big goals for 2021.

[You can watch the interview with Quincy Larson (me) here](https://youtu.be/pkNzU-5oDiA?t=9357).

### Naomi Meyer talk on Internationalization in React

Naomi Meyer will share best practices in the related fields of internationalization (I18N), localization (L10N), and Globalization (G11N). She'll share some related React tooling recommendations.

[You can watch Naomi's talk here](https://youtu.be/pkNzU-5oDiA?t=14402).

### David Khourshid talk on Model-Driven Development

David Khourshid will introduce you to Model-Driven Development and "how state machines and statecharts can be used to model even the most complex logic and automatically visualize, generate tests, produce documentation, and more."

[You can watch David's talk here](https://youtu.be/pkNzU-5oDiA?t=16541).

## Reactathon 2020 Day 3 Talks

### Becca Bailey talk on React Codebase Refactoring Tips

Becca Bailey will start off the day right with what I nominate as the best talk title of the conference: "Konmari Your Code: Finding Joy in Refactoring."

She'll share tips for simplifying your React codebase, stress-free refactoring, and more.

[You can watch Becca's talk here](https://youtu.be/Sz7SImkdIpo?t=4039).

### Lee Robinson talk on Client-side VS Server-side Rendering

Lee Robinson will explore data fetching with the React-powered Next.js framework. He'll talk about Client-side Rendering VS Server-side Rendering, and other important web development concepts.

[You can watch Lee's talk here](https://youtu.be/Sz7SImkdIpo?t=5985).

### Brian Leroux talk on Deno

Brian Leroux will talk about Deno, the new JavaScript runtime from the same creator of Node.js.

Brian will demonstrate some of the key differences between Deno and Node by deploying his own serverless backend using AWS Lambda.

[You can watch Brian's talk here](https://youtu.be/Sz7SImkdIpo?t=6903).

### Cassidy Williams talk on Sci-Fi Inspired User Interfaces

Cassidy Williams will talk about Sci-Fi inspired user interfaces. If you're familiar with Cassidy and her developer-themed Tik-Tok videos, you already know you're in for a treat.

[You can watch Cassidy's talk here](https://youtu.be/Sz7SImkdIpo?t=14393).

### Live Taping of the Syntax.fm Podcast with Wes Bos and Scott Tolinsky

And finally, Day 3 ended with a live recording of the Syntax.fm podcast. Hosts Wes Bos and Scott Tolinsky shared some coding insights, jokes, and as always, some "tasty treats."

Like the other Syntax.fm live tapings I've seen, it was a blast, with lots of audience participation.

[You can watch the live recording of the Syntax.fm podcast here](https://youtu.be/Sz7SImkdIpo?t=16229).

## That's all, folks. I hope you enjoy these talks, and look for more full-length conference live-streams [on freeCodeCamp's YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/freecodecamp) in the future.
