On this week's episode of the podcast, freeCodeCamp founder Quincy Larson interviews Joe Hill. He's a software engineer who works on a data platform for NASA.

Joe taught himself programming for 4 years while working as a janitor. As the single father of two Autistic boys, he first used his programming skills to build an iPad app to help them learn how to talk.

We talk about:

* Data Engineering and wrangling Department of Defense data into a central platform
    
* The role of soft skills in getting things done in big organizations
    
* The need for patience and practice in self-teaching
    
* How to stop jumping from one tool to another and to instead go deep
    
* Tips for parents raising kids with Autism
