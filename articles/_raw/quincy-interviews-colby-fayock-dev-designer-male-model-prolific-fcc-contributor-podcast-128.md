On this week's episode of the podcast, I interview Colby Fayock. He's a Software Engineer and prolific teacher who has created 68 tutorials for freeCodeCamp, and more than 100 videos on his YouTube – all freely available.

We talk about:

* Colby's early days doing design work for local bands
    
* How Colby went to art school, then pivoted that into a software development
    
* His early career at ThinkGeek where he not only did web dev but also worked as a male model for their products.
    
* Colby's day-to-day work as a developer experience engineer, building demo applications and SDKs
    
* How Colby uses AI tools in his day-to-day work, and what he thinks its current limits are.
    

Can you guess what song I'm playing on my bass during the intro? It's from a 1995 punk song.
