In this talk, Valve programers who created the game Portal discuss problems they faced in development and how they solved them. Leaning about how they solved Portal problems can give you insight into how to design better games.

This lecture is the final lecture of CS50's Introduction to Game Development course from Harvard University. The course explores principles of 2D and 3D graphics, animation, sound, and collision detection using frameworks like Unity and LÖVE 2D, as well as languages like Lua and C#.

You can watch the lecture on the [freeCodeCamp.org YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=riijspB9DIQ).
