The amount of diverse skills required to create a modern web application can be intimidating to beginners. But with the right teacher and the right mindset, everybody can learn to create complex web applications.

We just published Web Applications for Everybody on the freeCodeCamp.org YouTube channel. This 14-hour course is an introduction to web application development.

Charles Severance (aka Dr. Chuck) teaches this course. He is a Clinical Professor and teaches in the School of Information at the University of Michigan. He is also the teacher who created Python for Everybody, which is one of the most popular online programming courses in the world.

This course is an introduction to building web applications for anybody who already has a basic understanding of responsive web design with JavaScript,  HTML, and CSS. You will develop web and database applications in PHP, using SQL for database creation, as well as functionality in JavaScript, jQuery, and JSON.

You’ll learn basic concepts, like database design, while working on projects that require the development of increasing challenging web apps. From installing a text editor to understanding how a web browser interacts with a web server to handling events with JQuery, you’ll gain a complete introductory overview of web application development.

Here are some of the topics covered in this course:

* Web Applications and the Request/Response Cycle
* Understanding Browser Developer Mode
* HTML - HyperText Markup Language 
* CSS - Cascading Style Sheets
* JavaScript
* JQuery
* JSON
* Installing MAMP and XAMPP
* PHP
* Single Table SQL

In addition to learning about these topics, you will get hands-on practice by building various projects.
