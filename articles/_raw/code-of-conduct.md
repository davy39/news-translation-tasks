freeCodeCamp is a friendly place to learn to code. We’re committed to keeping it that way.

By using freeCodeCamp, you agree that you'll follow this code of conduct.

In short: Be nice. No harassment, trolling, or spamming.

* **Harassment** includes sexual language and imagery, deliberate intimidation, stalking, name-calling, unwelcome attention, libel, and any malicious hacking or social engineering. freeCodeCamp should be a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, national origin, or religion (or lack thereof).
* **Trolling** includes posting inflammatory comments to provoke an emotional response or disrupt discussions.
* **Spamming** includes posting off-topic messages to disrupt discussions, promote a product, solicit donations, advertise a job / internship / gig, or flooding discussions with files or text.

If you see someone harass, troll, or spam anywhere in the freeCodeCamp community (forum, chat, YouTube, etc.), notify us in the  **[admin chat room](https://discord.gg/PRyKn3Vbay)** – preferably with a screen shot and URL of the offense. The moderator team will take any action we deem appropriate, up to and including banning the offender from freeCodeCamp.

Also, no bots are allowed in the freeCodeCamp community without prior written permission from **[Quincy Larson](https://www.twitter.com/ossia)**.
