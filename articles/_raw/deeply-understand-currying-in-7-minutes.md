Eric Elliott’s exceptional [Composing Software](https://medium.com/javascript-scene/the-rise-and-fall-and-rise-of-functional-programming-composable-software-c2d91b424c8c) series is initially what got me excited about functional programming. It's a must-read.

At one point in the series, he mentioned _currying_. Both computer science and mathematics agree on the definition:

> Currying turns multi-argument functions into unary (single argument) functions.

Curried functions take many arguments **one at a time**. So if you have

```js
greet = (greeting, first, last) => `${greeting}, ${first} ${last}`;

greet('Hello', 'Bruce', 'Wayne'); // Hello, Bruce Wayne
```

Properly currying `greet` gives you

```js
curriedGreet = curry(greet);

curriedGreet('Hello')('Bruce')('Wayne'); // Hello, Bruce Wayne
```

This 3-argument function has been turned into three unary functions. As you supply one parameter, a new function pops out expecting the next one.

![dog-properly-currying-a-function-1](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2019/07/dog-properly-currying-a-function-1.jpeg)

## Properly?

I say "properly currying" because some `curry` functions are more flexible in their usage. Currying's great in theory, but invoking a function for each argument gets tiring in JavaScript.

[Ramda's](https://ramdajs.com/) `curry` function lets you invoke `curriedGreet` like this:

```js
// greet requires 3 params: (greeting, first, last)

// these all return a function looking for (first, last)
curriedGreet('Hello');
curriedGreet('Hello')();
curriedGreet()('Hello')()();

// these all return a function looking for (last)
curriedGreet('Hello')('Bruce');
curriedGreet('Hello', 'Bruce');
curriedGreet('Hello')()('Bruce')();

// these return a greeting, since all 3 params were honored
curriedGreet('Hello')('Bruce')('Wayne');
curriedGreet('Hello', 'Bruce', 'Wayne');
curriedGreet('Hello', 'Bruce')()()('Wayne');
```

Notice you can choose to give multiple arguments in a single shot. This implementation's more useful while writing code.

And as demonstrated above, you can invoke this function forever without parameters and it’ll always return a function that expects the remaining parameters.

## How's This Possible?

Mr. Elliot shared a `curry` implementation much like Ramda's. Here’s the code, or as he aptly called it, a magic spell:

```js
const curry = (f, arr = []) => (...args) =>
  ((a) => (a.length === f.length ? f(...a) : curry(f, a)))([...arr, ...args]);
```

## Umm… ?

![that-code-is-hard-to-read-cmm](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2019/07/that-code-is-hard-to-read-cmm.jpeg)

Yeah, I know... It's incredibly concise, so let's refactor and appreciate it together.

## This Version Works the Same

I've also sprinkled `debugger` statements to examine it in Chrome Developer Tools.

```js
curry = (originalFunction, initialParams = []) => {
  debugger;

  return (...nextParams) => {
    debugger;

    const curriedFunction = (params) => {
      debugger;

      if (params.length === originalFunction.length) {
        return originalFunction(...params);
      }

      return curry(originalFunction, params);
    };

    return curriedFunction([...initialParams, ...nextParams]);
  };
};
```

Open your [Developer Tools](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/) and follow along!

## Let's Do This!

Paste `greet` and `curry` into your console. Then enter `curriedGreet = curry(greet)` and begin the madness.

### Pause on line 2

Inspecting our two params we see `originalFunction` is `greet` and `initialParams` defaulted to an empty array because we didn’t supply it. Move to the next breakpoint and, oh wait… that’s it.

Yep! `curry(greet)` just returns a new function that expects 3 more parameters. Type `curriedGreet` in the console to see what I’m talking about.

When you’re done playing with that, let’s get a bit crazier and do
`sayHello = curriedGreet('Hello')`.

### Pause on line 4

![](https://cdn-media-1.freecodecamp.org/images/1*FXCJQi5Numlbis5d_bGsjw.png)

Before moving on, type `originalFunction` and `initialParams` in your console. Notice we can still access those 2 parameters even though we’re in a completely new function? That’s because functions returned from parent functions enjoy their parent’s scope.

#### Real-life inheritance

After a parent function passes on, they leave their parameters for their kids to use. Kind of like inheritance in the real life sense.

`curry` was initially given `originalFunction` and `initialParams` and then returned a “child” function. Those 2 variables weren’t [disposed of](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Memory_Management) yet because maybe that child needs them. If he doesn’t, _then_ that scope gets cleaned up because when no one references you, that’s when you truly die.

### Ok, back to line 4…

![](https://cdn-media-1.freecodecamp.org/images/1*_TFVnxtqgisi1i0q_K3dUQ.png)

Inspect `nextParams` and see that it’s `['Hello']`…an array? But I thought we said `curriedGreet(‘Hello’)` , not `curriedGreet(['Hello'])`!

Correct: we invoked `curriedGreet` with `'Hello'`, but thanks to the [rest syntax](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Spread_operator#Rest_syntax_%28parameters%29), we’ve _turned_ `'Hello'` into `['Hello']`.

### Y THO?!

`curry` is a general function that can be supplied 1, 10, or 10,000,000 parameters, so it needs a way to reference all of them. Using the rest syntax like that captures every single parameter in one array, making `curry`'s job much easier.

Let’s jump to the next `debugger` statement.

### Line 6 now, but hold on.

You may have noticed that line 12 actually ran before the `debugger` statement on line 6\. If not, look closer. Our program defines a function called `curriedFunction` on line 5, uses it on line 12, and _then_ we hit that `debugger` statement on line 6\. And what’s `curriedFunction` invoked with?

```js
[...initialParams, ...nextParams];
```

Yuuuup. Look at `params` on line 5 and you’ll see `['Hello']`. Both `initialParams` and `nextParams` were arrays, so we flattened and combined them into a single array using the handy [spread operator](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Spread_operator#Syntax).

Here’s where the good stuff happens.

![](https://cdn-media-1.freecodecamp.org/images/1*pM31i2QVNxVUiqj9aZzVvg.png)

Line 7 says “If `params` and `originalFunction` are the same length, call `greet` with our params and we’re done.” Which reminds me…

### JavaScript functions have lengths too

This is how `curry` does its magic! This is how it decides whether or not to ask for more parameters.

In JavaScript, a function’s `.length` property tells you _how many arguments it expects_.

```js
greet.length; // 3

iTakeOneParam = (a) => {};
iTakeTwoParams = (a, b) => {};

iTakeOneParam.length; // 1
iTakeTwoParams.length; // 2
```

If our provided and expected parameters match, we’re good, just hand them off to the original function and finish the job!

### That’s baller ?

But in our case, the parameters and function length are _not_ the same. We only provided `‘Hello’`, so `params.length` is 1, and `originalFunction.length` is 3 because `greet` expects 3 parameters: `greeting, first, last`.

### So what happens next?

Well since that `if` statement evaluates to `false`, the code will skip to line 10 and re-invoke our master `curry` function. It re-receives `greet` and this time, `'Hello'`, and begins the madness all over again.

That’s [recursion](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Recursion), my friends.

`curry` is essentially an infinite loop of self-calling, parameter-hungry functions that won’t rest until their guest is full. Hospitality at its finest.

![](https://cdn-media-1.freecodecamp.org/images/1*AZKiupYSanV5iJSQWrtUwg.png)

### Back at line 2

Same parameters as before, except `initialParams` is `['Hello']` this time. Skip again to exit the cycle. Type our new variable into the console, `sayHello`. It’s another function, still expecting more parameters, but we’re getting warmer…

Let’s turn up the heat with `sayHelloToJohn = sayHello('John')`.

We’re inside line 4 again, and `nextParams` is `['John']`. Jump to the next debugger on line 6 and inspect `params`: it’s `['Hello', 'John']`! ?

![](https://cdn-media-1.freecodecamp.org/images/1*pej6yZ-vGvA2T9LgIIc-vg.png)

### Why, why, why?

Because remember, line 12 says “Hey `curriedFunction`, he gave me `'Hello'` last time and `‘John’` this time. Take them both in this array `[...initialParams, ...nextParams]`.”

![](https://cdn-media-1.freecodecamp.org/images/1*Ljvk2BMLxIsbJ09idgStdg.png)

Now `curriedFunction` again compares the `length` of these `params` to `originalFunction`, and since `2 < 3` we move to line 10 and call `curry` once again! And of course, we pass along `greet` and our 2 params, `['Hello', 'John']`

![](https://cdn-media-1.freecodecamp.org/images/1*EYv9jdo2id8tynbTI5SXYQ.png)

We’re so close, let’s finish this and get the full greeting back!

`sayHelloToJohnDoe = sayHelloToJohn('Doe')`

I think we know what happens next.

![](https://cdn-media-1.freecodecamp.org/images/1*tMJvls2j9eAjrCGykVN84g.png)![](https://cdn-media-1.freecodecamp.org/images/1*NHm1TMo8Tjk7jQVlGGa9zQ.png)![](https://cdn-media-1.freecodecamp.org/images/1*eTwjEYLKGCGJoqdP4Xe9hA.png)

## The Deed Is Done

`greet` got his parameters, `curry` stopped looping, and we’ve received our greeting: `Hello, John Doe`.

Play around with this function some more. Try supplying multiple or no parameters in one shot, get as crazy as you want. See how many times `curry` has to recurse before returning your expected output.

```js
curriedGreet('Hello', 'John', 'Doe');
curriedGreet('Hello', 'John')('Doe');
curriedGreet()()('Hello')()('John')()()()()('Doe');
```

Many thanks to [Eric Elliott](https://medium.com/@_ericelliott) for introducing this to me, and even more thanks to you for appreciating `curry` with me. Until next time!
