Algebra concepts are all over the place in most computer programs. Programs often include polynomials, factoring, inequalities, and more. 

You will often see plenty of other algebraic concepts in code:

* Programs contain variables. 
* Programs evaluate expressions involving those variables.
* Code can be simplified and transformed using abstract rules. 
* Programs contain functions, and functions can be defined in terms of other functions.

Most programmers should have an understanding of Algebra. That is why we released a [full College Algebra course](https://youtu.be/LwCRRUa8yTU) on the freeCodeCamp.org YouTube channel.

This course was created by Dr. Linda Green who teaches at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. She has years of experience teaching algebra to undergraduate students. And she has condensed College Algebra basics down into this 7-hour course.

Here are all the Algebra concepts you will learn about in this course:

* Exponent Rules
* Simplifying using Exponent Rules
* Simplifying Radicals
* Factoring
* Factoring - Additional Examples
* Rational Expressions
* Solving Quadratic Equations
* Rational Equations
* Solving Radical Equations
* Absolute Value Equations
* Interval Notation
* Absolute Value Inequalities
* Compound Linear Inequalities
* Polynomial and Rational Inequalities
* Distance Formula
* Midpoint Formula
* Circles: Graphs and Equations
* Lines: Graphs and Equations
* Parallel and Perpendicular Lines
* Functions
* Toolkit Functions
* Transformations of Functions
* Introduction to Quadratic Functions
* Graphing Quadratic Functions
* Standard Form and Vertex Form for Quadratic Functions
* Justification of the Vertex Formula
* Polynomials
* Exponential Functions
* Exponential Function Applications
* Exponential Functions Interpretations
* Compound Interest
* Logarithms: Introduction
* Log Functions and Their Graphs
* Combining Logs and Exponents
* Log Rules
* Solving Exponential Equations Using Logs
* Solving Log Equations
* Doubling Time and Half Life
* Systems of Linear Equations
* Distance, Rate, and Time Problems
* Mixture Problems
* Rational Functions and Graphs
* Combining Functions
* Composition of Functions
* Inverse Functions

Also, we recommend you pull out some paper and a pencil and take physical notes – just like when you were back in a classroom.

This manual process of taking notes will help you better comprehend and retain these concepts, since Dr. Green moves fast and covers a lot of topics in a short time.
