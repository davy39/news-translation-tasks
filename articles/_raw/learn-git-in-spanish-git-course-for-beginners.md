Git is the version control system that most software companies use around the world. It's an essential tool for managing and tracking code changes effectively. If you are learning to code, you should definitely learn Git.

We just published a 1-hour course on the [freeCodeCamp.org Spanish YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/freecodecampespanol) that will teach you Git from scratch. You will go from the basic concepts like repositories, commits, and branches, to more advanced ones like best practices, cherry picking and `.gitignore`. 

By the end of the course, you will be able to use Git to track changes in a software project.

💡 **Tip:** The course will also introduce you to the basics of GitHub, a platform where you can host your Git repositories and collaborate with other developers.

If you have Spanish-speaking friends, you are welcome to share the **[Spanish version of this article](https://www.freecodecamp.org/espanol/news/curso-de-git-en-espanol-aprende-git)** with them.

This course was created by Pedro Plasencia. Pedro is a web developer who loves teaching and sharing his knowledge and experience with his Spanish-speaking community of developers, "Programación en Español".
