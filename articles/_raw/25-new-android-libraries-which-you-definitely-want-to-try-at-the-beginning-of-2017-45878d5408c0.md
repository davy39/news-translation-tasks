This is a list of 25 best Android libraries **released in January and February 2017.** All of these are worth trying out — they are not in ranked order. Let’s get started!

1. [**Lottie**](https://github.com/airbnb/lottie-android)  
This is a library that parses [Adobe After Effects](http://www.adobe.com/products/aftereffects.html) animations exported as JSON with [Bodymovin](https://github.com/bodymovin/bodymovin) (After Effects plugin for exporting animations to SVG/Canvas/HTML + JavaScript) and renders them natively on mobile.   
There is also an example app available in the [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.airbnb.lottie).  
The more than 7,500 Github users who starred this library can not be wrong!

2. [**Toasty**](https://github.com/GrenderG/Toasty)  
This is a library for creating customized `Toasts`. As the author described the lib, it is:

> _“The usual Toast, but with steroids.”_

You can find screenshots and the link to the library below.

3. [**StyleableToast**](https://github.com/Muddz/StyleableToast)  
This is another library for `Toasts` customization. It adds:

> _“variety of styling options that gives your app and user experience that little extra unique feeling! Style your toast either by code or in styles.xml!”_

[_StyleableToast - A library that takes the standard Android toast to the next level with a variety of styling options…_github.com](https://github.com/Muddz/StyleableToast)

4. [**Store**](https://github.com/NYTimes/Store)  
Store is a library for Async Data Loading and Caching. According to the documentation:

> _“Store is a class that simplifies fetching, parsing, storage, and retrieval of data in your application. A Store is similar to the [Repository pattern](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ff649690.aspx) while exposing a Reactive API built with RxJava that adheres to a unidirectional data flow.”_

The documentation is really comprehensive and the lib is for sure worth trying. You can check many flows such as data requests, caching and parsing.

5. [**PreviewSeekBar**](https://github.com/rubensousa/PreviewSeekBar)  
If you use Google Play Movies, you have probably noticed this great animated `SeekBar` with a preview of the movie. It turned out that [Rúben Sousa](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/25-new-android-libraries-which-you-definitely-want-to-try-at-the-beginning-of-2017-45878d5408c0/undefined) implemented that as an open-source library. The gif below gives a good flavor of its functionalities. If your app is for instance a movie player, you should definitely try it!

It is new approach to a design of a top bar (which we know from `ActionBar/Toolbar` implementation), in conjunction with `DrawerLayout`, inspired by [Gmail Mobile from Weekz](https://material.uplabs.com/posts/gmail-mobile-concept). You can check, how it works below:

18. [**Bridge**](https://github.com/afollestad/bridge)

> _“Bridge is a simple but powerful HTTP networking library for Android. It features a Fluent chainable API, powered by Java/Android’s `URLConnection` classes for maximum compatibility and speed.”_

This library has a really comprehensive documentation and is definitely worth checking out.

19. [**Ason**](https://github.com/afollestad/ason)  
It is the second library from [Aidan Follestad](https://twitter.com/afollestad). Its main idea is to simplify an interaction with JSON. The library:

> _“also makes (de)serialization painless.”_

The documentation is also pretty good. You can check it out here:

20. [**ObjectBox**](https://github.com/greenrobot/ObjectBox)  
I assume that majority of you knows [greenrobot](http://greenrobot.org/). If not, they developed [GreenDAO](https://github.com/greenrobot/greenDAO) and [EventBus](https://github.com/greenrobot/EventBus). Now, this is time for a new database for objects focused on performance. As greenrobot claims,

> _“**Performance** is the number one reason why we created ObjectBox. Previously, we created greenDAO, the fastest Object/Relational Mapper (ORM) for Android and SQLite. Since its first release in 2011, we gained a lot of insight into object persistence — and the performance limitations imposed by SQLite. We realized that in order to improve performance on mobile significantly, we needed to go to the core and build a database designed for objects.”_

![Image](https://cdn-media-1.freecodecamp.org/images/Pm9sq17UtBbJD8LijxCcGV2Pat1apYmsyf8X)

You can read more about it [here](http://greenrobot.org/announcement/introducing-objectbox-beta/). Please take into consideration that ObjectBox is currently in beta (version 0.9.7 ).

21. [**FlowLayout**](https://github.com/nex3z/FlowLayout)  
This library:

> _“allows child views flow to next row when there is not enough space._   
> _The spacing between child views can be calculated by the FlowLayout so that the views are evenly placed.”_

![Image](https://cdn-media-1.freecodecamp.org/images/J1ysVuWIN0Hp-25lXi9a1QBGhlCPGjE5uK4E)

Please note that this is still in its early stages of development.

22. [**Unofficial Google Actions Java SDK**](https://github.com/frogermcs/Google-Actions-Java-SDK)  
This is a polish accent from [Mirek Stanek](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/25-new-android-libraries-which-you-definitely-want-to-try-at-the-beginning-of-2017-45878d5408c0/undefined). Because of the fact that the official Google Actions SDK is written in Node.js, he introduced his unofficial version written natively in Java. According to the _README:_

> _“Google Actions Java SDK is built based on official Node.js library, but it’s not a mirror copy of it. The goal is to make it fully compatible with [Conversational Protocol](https://developers.google.com/actions/reference/conversation) of Assistant Platform.”_

23. [**Wearable Reply**](https://github.com/klinker24/wearable-reply)  
On 9th of February 2017 Google released a new [Android Wear 2.0](https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2017/02/AndroidWear2.html).   
[Luke Klinker](https://twitter.com/lukeklinker) found a missing API and released the library for this OS. It:

> _“allows for quick and easy text input, whether that is from your voice, a keyboard, or canned responses. The missing API is now available!”_

24. [**Shortbread**](https://github.com/MatthiasRobbers/shortbread)  
This is a library:

> _“generates [app shortcuts](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/ui/shortcuts.html) for Activities and methods annotated with `@Shortcut`. No need to touch the manifest, create XML files or use the shortcut manager. Just annotate the code that you want the shortcut to call.”_

Currently, it’s at version 1.0.0.
