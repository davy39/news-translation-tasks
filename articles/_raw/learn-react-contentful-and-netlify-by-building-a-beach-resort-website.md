In this full course from John Smilga you will learn React by building a beach resort website project. The project uses React router for routing, React context API for state management, Contentful headless CMS for data management, and Netlify to host the application.

You will build a responsive website that will display hotel rooms and allow users to filter the rooms. The data comes directly from the Contentful headless CMS. This is a comprehensive 6 hour course and will cover everything you need to know in detail.

You can watch the full video course on the [freeCodeCamp.org YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXJOvkVYQqA) (6 hour watch).
