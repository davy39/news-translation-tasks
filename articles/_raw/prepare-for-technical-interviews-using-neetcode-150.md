Technical interviews can be intimidating, especially when you're preparing for roles at top tech companies. To succeed, you need a solid grasp of algorithms, data structures, and problem-solving strategies.

The NeetCode 150 is an invaluable resource—a curated list of the most essential LeetCode problems that cover key algorithmic patterns and topics frequently tested in interviews.

We just published a course on the freeCodeCamp.org YouTube channel, created by **@DestinationFAANG**, that dives deep into the **NeetCode 150**. This course provides a comprehensive walkthrough of these problems, offering detailed explanations, practical solutions, and tips for tackling each challenge effectively.

### What’s in the Course?

The course spans over **38 hours** of in-depth content, meticulously covering the NeetCode 150 problems. Each problem is explained step-by-step, ensuring that even beginners can follow along. Here's what you can expect:

* **Key Topics and Patterns:** Problems are grouped by topics such as arrays, strings, linked lists, binary trees, dynamic programming, and graph algorithms. This structured approach helps you build a comprehensive understanding of the key concepts.
    
* **Detailed Solutions:** Every problem includes a clear explanation of the logic, coding implementation (in Java), and optimization techniques to solve it efficiently.
    
* **Real-World Relevance:** These problems are selected based on their frequency in actual tech interviews, ensuring that your preparation is targeted and practical.
    

### Course Highlights

* **Introduction and Foundations:** The course begins with simpler problems like "Contains Duplicate" and "Valid Anagram" to establish a strong base.
