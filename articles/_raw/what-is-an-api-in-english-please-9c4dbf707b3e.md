Here are three Sunday reads that are worth your time:

1. What is an API? In English, please: [5 minute read](http://bit.ly/2bqEwHX)
2. How I made my first million dollars (in pro bono code): [9 minute read](http://bit.ly/2bkxVib)
3. Hacking Imgur for fun and profit: [8 minute read](http://bit.ly/2b3kPb2)

Bonus: I just finished Elon Musk’s biography and it’s definitely worth reading. You can get the audiobook for free with a free trial of Audible, then learn while you commute: [13 hour listen](http://amzn.to/2aAvfvM)

Happy coding,

Quincy Larson, teacher at [Free Code Camp](https://www.freecodecamp.com)
