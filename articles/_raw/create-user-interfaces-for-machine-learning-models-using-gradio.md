Adjusting, visualizing, and sharing machine learning models can be much easier with a sleek user interface.

We just published a course on the freeCodeCamp.org YouTube channel that will teach you how to use Gradio to create intuitive user interfaces for machine learning models.

Abdul from 1littlecoder developed this course. He has helped many people learn about machine learning with hundreds of videos on his YouTube channel.

Gradio is a Python library that gives the ability to demo your machine learning model with a friendly web interface so that anyone can use it, anywhere.

Here are the sections covered in this course:

* What's the problem with current ML prototyping  
* What's Gradio & Advantages of Gradio    
* Getting started with Gradio        
* Gradio Components        
* Gradio Multiple inputs        
* Debugging & Flagging        
* Improving UI + UX        
* Gradio Sharing + Auth        
* Deploying DL Gradio App  with Hugging Face Spaces        
* Course Finish-up Summary
