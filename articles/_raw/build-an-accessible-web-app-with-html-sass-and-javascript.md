Are you looking for another web app project to build? Are you interested in incorporating accessibility into your websites? Do you want to learn more about creating mobile-first apps?

If you answered "yes" to any of those questions, you're going to like this new tutorial we just released on the freeCodeCamp.org YouTube channel.

In this tutorial, you will build a To Do list app with HTML, Sass, and plain vanilla JavaScript. Your app will be responsive, with mobile-first in mind.

The app will also be built with accessibility (A11y) in mind for keyboard navigation and screen readers. You will also use the Web Storage API to create a persistent data store so the list items reappear any time we visit the web app.

This tutorial was created by Dave Gray. Dave is a university instructor who teaches web development. He also has a YouTube channel with many excellent tutorials.

Here are the topics Dave covers in this tutorial:

* HTML foundation
* SASS / CSS styles
* Javascript Classes
* Javascript Functions
* Testing the Accessibility features
* Code clean up and enhancements for A11y
* Testing the fixes & enhancements for the app
* Imroving the app
