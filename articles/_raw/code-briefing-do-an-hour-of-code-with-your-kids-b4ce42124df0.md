Here are three stories we published this week that are worth your time:

1. This week, do an Hour of Code with your kids: [3 minute read](http://bit.ly/2h76kXk)
2. The hardest part of learning to code is also the funnest part: [8 minute read](http://bit.ly/2gPkIQS)
3. How a single indexing mistake nearly cost us a boat-load of money: [5 minute read](http://bit.ly/2gC5QYn)

Bonus: Our community designed a cryptography-inspired ugly Christmas sweater. ? It’s only available for a few more days. You can r[ead about its origins](http://bit.ly/2fVxpwD) and g[et one in our shop.](http://bit.ly/2cGNEx2)
