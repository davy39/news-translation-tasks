This full course from deeplizard introduces the concept of client-side artificial neural networks. You will learn how to deploy and run models along with full deep learning applications in the browser! This is done using TensorFlow.js (TFJS), TensorFlow’s JavaScript library.

By the end of this video course, you will have built and deployed a web application that runs a neural network in the browser to classify images. You will learn about client-server deep learning architectures, converting Keras models to TFJS models, serving models with Node.js, tensor operations, and more!
