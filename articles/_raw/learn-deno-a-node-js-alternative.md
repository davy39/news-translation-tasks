Deno is a Node.js  alternative created by Ryan Dahl, the same person who created Node.js.

Many people, including Ryan Dahl, think that Deno is superiod to Node.js. We've posted a 6-hour video course all about Deno on the freeCodeCamp.org YouTube channel. Decide for yourself if it is better than Node.

You will learn the basics of Deno in the course. Deno can be used with JavaScript or TypeScript, but it is more common to use TypeScript. This course includes a mini crash-course on TypeScript.

This course was created by The Codeholic. By the end of the course, you will have used Deno to build a survey app with a REST API using MongoDB. Then you will be ready to start implementing your own applications based on Deno.

Here are the things covered in the course:

* What is Deno?
* How to install
* "Hello World" in Deno
* Deno commands
* TypeScript basics
* Main Demo features
* Deno standard library
* Third party libraries
* Working with the file system
* Create a basic HTTP server
* Using npm packages
* Building a real-world project
* Deno best practices

Watch the [full course on the freeCodeCamp.org YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQUy8ENesGY) (6 hour watch).
