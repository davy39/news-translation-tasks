Building a complex website is a great way to learn how a bunch of technologies work together.

We just posted a 10-hour course on the freeCodeCamp.org YouTube channel that will teach you how to build a hotel management website using Next.js, React, Sanity.io, Tailwind CSS, and Stripe's payment API. Lari Bright developed this course.

### Core Technologies Explained

Before delving into the course outline, let's unpack the core technologies you'll be working with:

* **Next.js**: A React framework that enables functionality such as server-side rendering and generating static websites, making your application faster and more efficient.
* **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces, known for its efficiency and flexibility in creating dynamic, high-performing web applications.
* **Sanity.io**: A platform for structured content that comes with an open-source editing environment that allows you to manage and deliver digital content globally.
* **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework for rapidly building custom designs, providing low-level utility classes to build bespoke designs without leaving your HTML.
* **Stripe**: An online payment processing platform that's highly flexible and integrates easily with various web applications for secure and efficient financial transactions.
