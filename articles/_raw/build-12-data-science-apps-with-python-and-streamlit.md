If you want to get better at Data Science, you need to practice. 

We've released a course on the freeCodeCamp.org YouTube channel that will help you improve your data science skills by teaching you how to build 12 different interactive, data-driven web apps.

Chanin Nantasenamat teaches this course. Besides being known as the Data Professor on his YouTube channel, Chanin is an Associate Professor of Bioinfomatics where he teaches and does research at the intersection of machine learning and computational drug discovery.

You will learn how to create the data science apps with Streamlit. Streamlit is an open-source Python library for machine learning and data science. Streamlit makes it easy to create and share custom data science web apps.

Here are the 12 different apps you will create in this course:

* Simple Stock Price
* Simple Bioinformatics DNA Count
* EDA Basketball
* EDA Football
* EDA SP500 Stock Price
* EDA Cryptocurrency
* Classification Iris
* Classification Penguins
* Regression Boston Housing
* Regression Bioinformatics Solubility
* Deploy to Heroku
* Deploy to Streamlit Sharing
