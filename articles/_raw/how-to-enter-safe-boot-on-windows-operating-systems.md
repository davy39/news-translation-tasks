If you're using the Windows operating system, you might have heard the phrase "Rebooting to the safe boot" or something like that.

In this tutorial, I'll explain what that means and how you can do it on your Windows machine.

## What is Safe Boot or Safe Mode for Windows?

Safe Boot or Safe Mode starts the Windows operating system in an elementary state where it uses a minimal set of files and drivers. 

You might want to reboot to the safe boot for many reasons, from identifying any software/driver-related problems to doing something safely which might not be possible in your default mode of Windows.

## How to Enable Safe Boot

Firstly, you need to open the **run** program from your operating system. You can simply click on the search box from your taskbar, or you can also use the shortcut keys, `Windows Key` + `R`. 

Then type `msconfig` and press the **Enter** key, or simply click **OK**.

It will open the **System Configuration** window.

Simply go into the **Boot** section.

Check for the "Safe boot" option. You have to enable it. Simply check the box like in the image below:

Then you can just click "Apply", and then click "OK".

Make sure that you have saved all of your work because you need to restart your computer. Click "Restart". It will reboot your current operating system into safe mode.

## How to Disable Safe Boot

After finishing your task on the safe boot, you'll want to disable the safe boot to continue your regular boot, right? 

For that, we will follow all the processes mentioned above, but kind of in the reverse. Don't worry, as I am going to show you each step again.

Open the **Run** window again. I prefer the shortcut keys, `Windows Key` + `R`.

Type `msconfig` and click **OK**.

It will open the **System Configuration** window once more. Go to the **Boot** section.

Make sure to uncheck the box for "Safe boot". Then click "Apply" and then click "OK".

Make sure that you have saved all of your tasks, and click "Restart". Your computer will be rebooted into the default mode once again.
