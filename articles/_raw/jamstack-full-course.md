The JAMstack allows people to create websites that are simpler, faster, and more secure than other web development methods. Sites created with the JAMstack are delivered by pre-rendering files that are served directly from a CDN, removing the requirement to manage or run web servers.

We have released a full course on the JAMstack from Phil Hawksworth on the freeCodeCamp.org YouTube channel. Phil is part of the Developer Experience team at Netlify and is very experienced with the JAMstack.

First, you will learn what the JAMstack is and how it compares to other tech stacks. Then, you see how to use the JAMstack with six different examples, all demonstrating different ways to use the JAMstack. The examples continue to grow in scope throughout the course.

The six examples focus on the following topics:

* Creating a static site
* Changing the DOM with JavaScript
* Introducing a static site generator
* Generating pages from a content API
* Generating localized pages, with geo-IP routing at the CDN
* Client-side rendering targeted API content

At the end of the course, you will learn how start using the JAMstack in your own infrastructure. This will be especially helpful if you already have sites using a different architecture and you want to use the JAMstack next to it.

Watch the course below or on [the freeCodeCamp.org YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_l0qrPUJds) (4 hour watch).
