You are just about to learn about 20 great examples of code from 20 insanely talented developers.

Js13kGames is a JavaScript coding competition open to everyone and anyone wanting to try out Game Development. The 2021 winners have been announced, and you can play the games for free.

As the name suggests, all the code and game assets should be smaller than or equal to 13 kilobytes (that's exactly 13,312 bytes, because 13 x 1024) when zipped.

And the games are not permitted to use any libraries, images or data files hosted on a server or services that provide any type of data.

We [published a video](https://youtu.be/UiYhTcqx_wk) on the freeCodeCamp.org YouTube channel that shows off all the winning games. Below the video, you will see a list of all the winners and links to play their games.
