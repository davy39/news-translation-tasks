On this week's episode of the podcast, I interview Daniel Bourke. He's a Machine Learning Engineer and creator of many popular tutorials on YouTube. He's also a frequent freeCodeCamp contributor.

We talk about:

* How as a kid he hacked into his school's network and gave himself good grades, just like the kid from Wargames. (Don't try this at home.)
    
* What he learned from helping fix 5,000 people's computers
    
* How Machine Learning actually works. What the AI models are actually doing for you in the background.
    
* His advice for anyone getting into Machine Learning in 2024, in terms of what to prioritize learning
    

Can you guess what song I'm playing on my bass during the intro? It's from a 2020 song by an Australian musician.
