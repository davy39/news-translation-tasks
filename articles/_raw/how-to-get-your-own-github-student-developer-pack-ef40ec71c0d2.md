Hello people! Today I am going to show you how I got my student pack from GitHub and how you can get it too.

Here are some advantages of the student package:

* Unlimited private repositories.
* Access to developer tools for free.
* $50 in Digital Ocean credit.
* [Here](https://education.github.com/pack) is a complete list.

### Requirements

To get the student pack, you have to meet these requirements:

* Must be enrolled in a degree- or diploma-granting course of study.
* Must be a student aged 13+.
* Must have a GitHub account.

If you meet these requirements, we will continue.

### How to get the pack

You get access [here](https://education.github.com/pack/offers) and click to join GitHub Education.

You are going to see this:

Fill out this form and click on next.

Now we have two options for validating our school degree.

With an email from your school like myname@school.com.

Or

Upload proof of your academic status.

In my case, I uploaded my academic status in Brazilian Portuguese, and it worked very well. One week later I received this:

The Student Pack will last for two years. You can renew the plan if you are still studying at that point.

This is it. I hope you have enjoyed it, do not forget to ?. See you soon.
