The MERN stack is a popular method to develop full-stack web applications.

We just released a new course on the freeCodeCamp.org YouTube channel that will guide you through building dynamic, responsive web applications using the popular MERN stack.

The MERN stack, consisting of MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js, is a powerful combination of technologies that allows developers to create robust, scalable web applications. This comprehensive course, developed by Burak Orkmez, offers a hands-on approach to learning these technologies and how they work together.

Here is a brief overview of the core technologies:

1. MongoDB: Learn to work with this flexible, document-based NoSQL database.
    
2. Express.js: Master this minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework.
    
3. React: Dive into building interactive user interfaces with this popular JavaScript library.
    
4. Node.js: Understand how to use JavaScript on the server-side with this runtime environment.
    

The course is structured to provide a comprehensive learning experience:

1. App Showcase: Get inspired by seeing the final product you'll be building.
    
2. Server Setup: Learn how to set up your Node.js server with Express.js.
    
3. MongoDB Setup: Understand how to integrate MongoDB into your application.
    
4. SQL vs NoSQL: Gain insights into the differences between SQL and NoSQL databases.
    
5. Creating a Product Model: Learn about data modeling in MongoDB.
    
6. Building the API: Develop a robust RESTful API for your application.
    
7. Frontend Development: Create an interactive user interface with React.
    
8. Deployment: Master the process of deploying your full-stack application.
    

This course is perfect for aspiring web developers, those looking to expand their skill set, or anyone interested in modern web development practices. By the end of this course, you'll have the skills to build and deploy your own full-stack web applications using the MERN stack.
