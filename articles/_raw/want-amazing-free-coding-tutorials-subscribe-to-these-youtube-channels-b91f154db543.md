There are so many great FREE software tutorials and courses on YouTube!

I run the [freeCodeCamp ad-free YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/freecodecamp). We have full video courses and tutorials on many popular programming languages and frameworks (including [JavaScript](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkZNo7MFNFg), [Python](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfscVS0vtbw), [Java](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=grEKMHGYyns), [Ruby](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t_ispmWmdjY), [C](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJgsSFOSQv0), [C++](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLnPwxZdW4Y), [Angular](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OHbjep_WjQ), and [more](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLWKjhJtqVAbnupwRFOq9zGOWjdvPRtCmO)).

I’ve also come across many other YouTube channels that provide amazing free programming tutorials. The free tutorials on these channels are as good or better than ones you would pay for.

In this article I list ten YouTube channels you should subscribe to if you want to improve your coding skills. These are in no particular order.

It can be very helpful to watch tutorials on the same topic from different creators. Learning from multiple perspectives can help you understand the concepts in a deeper way.

There are many great channels that I did not have room for on this list. Let people know in the comment section about other channels they should check out for free programming tutorials.

### Coding Train

[**The Coding Train**](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvjgXvBlbQiydffZU7m1_aw)  
[_In this YouTube channel I publish "creative coding" video tutorials every week. Subjects covered range from the basics…_www.youtube.com](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvjgXvBlbQiydffZU7m1_aw)

It takes a lot of skill to record high quality tutorials live with no editing. But that is exactly what Daniel Shiffman of Coding Train does. His teaches complicated topics in a fun way that is easy to understand for beginners. Once you see the channel’s introduction video, you will know why you need to subscribe immediately.

### Traversy Media

[**Traversy Media**](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC29ju8bIPH5as8OGnQzwJyA)  
[_Traversy Media features the best online web development and programming tutorials for all of the latest web…_www.youtube.com](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC29ju8bIPH5as8OGnQzwJyA)

Brad Traversy’s passion for excellence really shows off in his videos. His no-fluff style is friendly and down-to-earth. He seems to understand exactly what self-taught programmers need to know. His channel features tutorials on a wide variety of web development frameworks and languages.

### Derek Banas

[**Derek Banas**](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCwRXb5dUK4cvsHbx-rGzSgw)  
[_I make tutorials based on your requests. I will cover any topic you can imagine. I upload new programming videos on…_www.youtube.com](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCwRXb5dUK4cvsHbx-rGzSgw)

Derek Banas is truly the jack-of-all trades programmer. He has professional-level tutorials on almost all popular (and some less popular) programming languages. He currently has more subscribers than anyone else on this list and it is completely deserved. His channel is a good first place to look if you want to learn a programming language.

### LearnCode.academy

[**LearnCode.academy**](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCVTlvUkGslCV_h-nSAId8Sw)  
[_100% FREE Web Development tutorials, web site design tutorials and more. Including, but not limited to: HTML, CSS…_www.youtube.com](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCVTlvUkGslCV_h-nSAId8Sw)

Will Stern from LeanCode.academy brings almost 20 years of web development experience to his tutorials. He has an amazing full course that covers everything you need to know to become a web developer.

### Dev Tips / FunFunFunction

[**DevTips**](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCyIe-61Y8C4_o-zZCtO4ETQ)  
[_DevTips is a weekly show for YOU who want to be inspired ? and learn ? about programming. Hosted by David and MPJ …ww_w.youtube.com](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCyIe-61Y8C4_o-zZCtO4ETQ)

Dev Tips has been around for a while but was recently taken over by David and MPJ. MPJ also runs the Fun Fun Function channel. Both are very helpful channels but Dev Tips has more tutorials than FunFunFunction. DevTips is a great channel if you want tutorials about JavaScript frameworks.

### LevelUpTuts

[**LevelUpTuts**](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCyU5wkjgQYGRB0hIHMwm2Sg)  
[_TLDR; 840+ free video tutorials created, recorded, edited, published and maintained by Scott Tolinski. The Story Level…_www.youtube.com](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCyU5wkjgQYGRB0hIHMwm2Sg)

LevelUpTuts has more tutorial videos that most other programming channels. This is a great channel to learn web development best practices. There is a focus on front-end frameworks. Scott Tolinski from LevelUpTuts also hosts one of the best web development podcast, [Syntax](https://syntax.fm/).

### The Net Ninja

[**The Net Ninja**](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCW5YeuERMmlnqo4oq8vwUpg)  
[_Black-belt your development skills. Tutorials on Node.js, JavaScript, CSS, HTML, Vue.js, React and much more…_www.youtube.com](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCW5YeuERMmlnqo4oq8vwUpg)

When Shaun from The Net Ninja says he will help you black-belt your development skills, he isn’t kidding. These are high quality tutorials that cover full stack web development. And everyone loves a UK accent, right?

### sentdex

[**sentdex**](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCfzlCWGWYyIQ0aLC5w48gBQ)  
[_Python Programming tutorials, going further than just the basics. Learn about machine learning, finance, data analysis…_www.youtube.com](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCfzlCWGWYyIQ0aLC5w48gBQ)

This is the go-to channel for advanced Python tutorials. While he explains things in a way a beginner can understand, he covers more advanced topics not covered on other channels. He has some great machine learning tutorials and even shows how to program a self driving car to play GTA5.

### CS Dojo

[**CS Dojo**](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCxX9wt5FWQUAAz4UrysqK9A)  
[_Hi everyone! My name is YK, and I make videos mostly about programming and computer science here. I also have a channel…_www.youtube.com](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCxX9wt5FWQUAAz4UrysqK9A)

CS Dojo is one of the fastest growing software channels on YouTube. The reason is obvious: CS Dojo has consistently high-quality tutorials. The channel focusses on Python, Data Structures, and Algorithms.
