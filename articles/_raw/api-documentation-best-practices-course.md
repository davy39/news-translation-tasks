Since APIs are the backbone of software development, effective API documentation is critical. 

We just published a course on the freeCodeCamp.org YouTube channel that will teach you how to write good documentation for APIs. You will learn how to craft, automate, and publish API documentation that is not only informative but also engaging and user-friendly.
