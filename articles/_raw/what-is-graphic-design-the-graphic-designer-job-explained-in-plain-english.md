Magazine covers, business logos, and book covers are all common examples of graphic design. But what is graphic design?

In this article, I'll explain what graphic design is, discuss different areas of graphic design, provide helpful learning resources, and talk about salaries for designers. 

## What is Graphic Design?

Graphic Design involves creating high quality visual content as a way to communicate a message to an audience. Businesses spend a lot of money to ensure that the designs for their company convey the right message for their brand.

You have probably heard of the phrase, "A picture is worth a thousand words". The ability to create a compelling visual to communicate a brand or message is a very powerful skill to have. 

## Basic Principles and Elements of Graphic Design

The basic principles and elements of design consist of color, space, size, shape, form, line, movement, emphasis, texture, balance, contrast and more. 

Graphic designers will study all of these principles and elements so they can understand how to create an effective design. 

CalArts provides an in depth look into all of these design principles through their [Graphic Design Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/graphic-design). 

Let's take a closer look at one of these important design elements, which is the effective use of color.

### How to Use Color in Graphic Design

The use of color in design can draw a user in and elicit an emotional response. As a designer, you have to take a lot of care in choosing the appropriate colors for that particular design. 

Let's take a look at an example. Have you ever wondered why companies use the color red for sales?

Red elicits a very strong response from humans. We are programmed to stop and take notice of it. 

It is a very effective color when you are trying to promote a sale and convey a sense of urgency to buy now while the price is low. 

In contrast, the color blue is perceived by humans to be safe and calming. Blue is a popular choice for financial institutions like banks.

These financial institutions want to the convey the message that "your money is safe with us".
