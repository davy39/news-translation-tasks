Coding projects is an important step in learning to code. When you build a complete project from start-to-finish, even if it is a simple project, it helps you understand how everything works together.

We've released an 8-hour course on the freeCodeCamp.org YouTube channel that will teach you how to code 15 different simple JavaScript projects. The course was created by John Smilga from the Coding Addict YouTube channel.

Starter code is given for each project so you can just focus on the JavaScript and not have to worry about the HTML or CSS.

Here are the projects you will make in the course:

1. Color Flipper
2. Counter
3. Reviews
4. Navbar
5. Sidebar
6. Modal
7. Questions
8. Menu
9. Video
10. Scroll
11. Tabs
12. Countdown
13. Lorem Ipsum
14. Grocery
15. Slider

These projects will give you experience with all the most common JavaScript features. By the end of the course, you will be ready to start building your own projects.

It will be helpful to have at least some basic experience with JavaScript before going through this course.

You can watch the full 8-hour course ad-free below or on the [freeCodeCamp.org YouTube channel](https://youtu.be/3PHXvlpOkf4).
