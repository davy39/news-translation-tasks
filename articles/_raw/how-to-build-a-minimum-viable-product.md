A minimum viable product (MVP) is a product with just enough features to be usable by early adopters. The goal is to get feedback from these early adopters and learn what features to add or remove from the product before releasing it to a wider audience.

In this course, you will learn how to quickly build an MVP for your application.

Ania Kubow teaches this course. Ania works for freeCodeCamp and has her own popular YouTube channel where she creates courses on a variety of technical topics.

In this course, you will learn why MVPs are important and how to easily create one with the Retool platform.
