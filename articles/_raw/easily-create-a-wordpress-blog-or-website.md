WordPress is one of the most popular–and easiest–ways to create a website or blog.

People can make all kinds of websites with WordPress. Some popular types include business websites, eCommerce sites, portfolios, and blogs.

We just published a course on the freeCodeCamp.org YouTube channel that will teach you how to use WordPress to easily create responsive blogs and websites using a drag and drop interface.

I created this course. I've also created many other popular WordPress courses on the freeCodeCamp.org channel. This is the first one that focusses on creating a blog.

You don't need any prior experience to follow along and there is no coding involved.

There are many reasons to make a WordPress blog, but some of the most common reasons include: sharing ideas and thoughts with the world, building a personal brand, promoting a business, and making money through blogging.

The course demonstrates how to use Elementor and a template to make it super quick to make a blog.

Here are the sections in this course:

* Setting up Hosting and Domain
* Installing WordPress
* WordPress Dashboard and Initial Settings
* Installing WordPress Theme
* Overview of Website
* Customizing Title
* Using Elementor to Edit Page
* Adding Images
* Customizing Website Elements
* Updating Site Menu and Categories
* Customizing Blog / Archive
* Customizing Single Blog Post
* Adding New Blog Post
* Customizing About and Contact Page
* Setting Up Website Forms Using WPForms
* Making URLs Look Better
* Updating Site for Responsive Design
* Updating Footer
* Creating New Pages
* Improving SEO (Search Engine Optimization)
