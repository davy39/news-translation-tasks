The freeCodeCamp community has published more than 10,000 tutorials on our publication over the years. But lately we've focused on creating even longer resources for learning math, programming, and computer science.

This is why we've created freeCodeCamp Press – a division of freeCodeCamp where we publish full-length books and handbooks on our online publication – all available to everyone for free.

## What is freeCodeCamp Press?

The freeCodeCamp community publication publishes technical tutorials in many forms. We publish shorter, more focused guides that aim to answer a specific question. We also publish longer walkthroughs that help you build a specific project.

And now we're publishing more comprehensive books and handbooks that will teach you everything you need to know to get started with a certain programming language or tool.

We're going to publish a lot more of these 5,000+ word handbooks and full-length books of 40,000 words or longer.

When an author submits a substantial tutorial that we consider to be a book or handbook, the editorial team reviews and edits it as usual. This helps make sure it's as complete and polished as possible.

We've also started designing cover images for our books and handbooks. If the author wants to take advantage of this professional cover and the consistent look it gives their handbook or book, one of our team members ([Estefania](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/author/estefaniacn)) designs and creates it. These covers look something like this:

![Image](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2023/08/Learn-Python-with-Code-Examples-Handbook-Cover--2-.png align="left")

*Example handbook cover (freeCodeCamp Press)*

After showing the proof to the author, we add the cover to the book or handbook and publish it. These covers help create a consistent look and feel for these substantial resources and make them easy to recognize.

## I Want to Write a Book or Handbook for freeCodeCamp. How Do I Do That?

If you're already a contributor to the publication, and you'd like to write a longer-form book or handbook, that's great! Pick a topic you know a lot about and start writing.

You can look at some of our other books and handbooks in the next section to get an idea what these books are like, and how they're structured.

It's a serious endeavor to write a book or a handbook, so take your time. Do your research, test your code, and create something great.

If you haven't applied to become a contributor to the publication yet, but think you and your books would be a good fit, you can [read our style guide here](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/developer-news-style-guide/). Then, if it looks like your style is similar to freeCodeCamp's, go ahead and apply.
