Have you ever just memorized that an algorithm is `O(n log n)` without truly understanding why? Our new algorithms course on the freeCodeCamp.org YouTube channel will help you build a deep intuition for how algorithms work.

This Algorithm Analysis Deep Dive course is taught by Computer Science Professor Dr. Qiang Hao. It goes beyond surface-level rules to help you understand the core mathematical reasoning behind performance.

Here are a list of the key sections in the course:

* Introduction to time complexity
    
* Time complexity analysis of insertion sort
    
* Asymptotic analysis
    
* Divide and conquer - Recurrence tree method
    
* Divide and conquer - Master theorem
    
* Probabilistic analysis - Quicksort
    
* Probabilistic analysis - Average case and expected value
    
* Heaps and heapsort
    
* Hashtables
    
* Binary search trees
    
* Amortized analysis
    

This course is designed to connect the dots between the code you write and the theory behind it. And you can get all the course materials, like quizzes, assignments, and solutions, from the companion GitHub repository to follow along and test your knowledge.
