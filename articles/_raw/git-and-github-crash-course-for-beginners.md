Git is important for any developer.

We just posted a course that will help you learn Git and GitHub from scratch with clear examples, real workflows, branching, merging, stashing, rebase, pull requests, and more. This course is great for beginners who want strong foundations. Sumit Saha developed this course.

Here are the things you will learn in this video:

* The difference between Git and GitHub in the simplest way
    
* How Git tracks your work using the working directory, staging area, and repository
    
* Core Git commands: add, commit, status, log, reset, restore, rm
    
* How to work with branches, merge updates, and fix merge conflicts
    
* How to push, pull, and sync your code with GitHub
    
* Using stash, revert, and rebase to handle real-world workflows
    
* How pull requests work and why teams use them
    

Watch the full course on the freeCodeCamp.org YouTube channel (1-hour watch).
