To get the best tech jobs, it can be helpful to understand how to apply data structures and algorithms to coding challenges.

We just published a comprehensive course on the freeCodeCamp.org channel about data structures and algorithms. This course will help you prepare for coding interviews and strengthen your foundational programming skills. Sheldon Chi developed this course.

Sheldon will break down the most essential data structures and algorithmic patterns. This course will help you build your intuition for efficiency and help you recognize which patterns to apply and how to avoid brute force solutions. And each concept is taught step by step, with practical code walkthroughs and tips for common pitfalls.

Here is the full list of sections in this course:

* Array
    
* String
    
* Set
    
* Control Flow & Looping
    
* Big O Notation
    
* Hashmap
    
* Hashmap practice problems
    
* Two Pointers
    
* Two Pointers practice problems
    
* Sliding Window
    
* Sliding Window practice problems
    
* Binary Search
    
* Binary Search practice problems
    
* Breadth-First Search (BFS) on Trees
    
* BFS on Graphs
    
* BFS practice problems
    
* Depth-First Search (DFS)
    
* DFS on Graphs
    
* DFS practice problems
    
* Backtracking
    
* Backtracking practice problems
    
* Priority Queue/heap
    
* Priority Queue/heap practice problems
