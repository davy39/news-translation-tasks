There are a ton of basic Python courses out there. But when you finish one of those, it can be hard to know what to learn next.

That is why we've released a 6-hour [intermediate Python course](https://youtu.be/HGOBQPFzWKo) on the freeCodeCamp.org YouTube channel.

Patrick Loeber created this course to help people learn the Python skills and concepts that are often not covered in beginner Python courses.

First, you will get a review of basic concepts such as lists, strings, and dictionaries, but with an emphasis on some lesser known  capabilities. Then, you will learn more advanced topics such as  threading, multiprocessing, context managers, generators, and more.

Here is a full list of all the topics covered in this course:

* Lists
* Tuples
* Dictionaries
* Sets
* Strings
* Collections
* Itertools
* Lambda Functions
* Exceptions and Errors
* Logging
* JSON
* Random Numbers
* Decorators
* Generators
* Threading vs Multiprocessing
* Multithreading
* Multiprocessing
* Function Arguments
* The Asterisk (*) Operator
* Shallow vs Deep Copying
* Context Managers

Watch the full [course on the freeCodeCamp.org YouTube channel](https://youtu.be/HGOBQPFzWKo) (6-hour watch).

And if you are new to Python, we recommend you start with this [free 14-hour course taught by University of Michigan professor Dr. Chuck](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/python-for-everybody/).
