Learn how to use Three.js and Blender to design a stunning and interactive 3D portfolio!

We just posted a course on the freeCodeCamp.org YouTube channel that will take you from the foundational concepts of 3D modeling in Blender to creating a fully functional, award-worthy portfolio website using Three.js.

You'll master essential techniques like proper quad topology for clean models and texture baking to optimize your scene for the web.

By the end, you'll have a delightful, cute, and professionally deployed Three.js project featuring all your hand-modeled creations. Andrew Woan developed this course.
