#### My road map ?️ to f[reeCodeCamp](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/) beyond the curriculum

A year ago, as I was finishing my bootcamp, a friend introduced me to [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) and I knew I had just found a great tool to help me reach my goals.

For those who don’t know about it, freeCodeCamp is this tiny-yet-impressively-effective non-profit that’s **teaching people to code for free.**

It does so through an **online curriculum of interactive step-by-step challenges. It is organized into six thematic certifications that form a big full-stack one.** I recently got my JavaScript certification ??‍? and couldn’t feel happier about it!

This **curriculum** is followed by tens of thousands of people around the world. Their **Medium channel is** Medium’s largest technical publication. These two are the **main front doors** to the freeCodeCamp universe.

But **there’s more to explore,** and I wish I had discovered all of this earlier.

Let’s dive in together!

#### 1. The weekly newsletter

Once you’ve created your freeCodeCamp [curriculum](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) account, in your account settings, you’ll find this inconspicuous line and you can move the button to “On”.

![Image](https://cdn-media-1.freecodecamp.org/images/VfrJqcVEAz3EX9xOoj8aPw1fv8O989BjoZVh)

[Quincy Larson](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-i-made-the-most-out-of-my-freecodecamp-journey-3f54679e0546/undefined)’s **email is always short yet packed with great articles to read and resources to uncover.**

I strongly suggest you give it a try.

#### 2. The YouTube channel

For reasons I cannot explain, it took me a while to find out about [this channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8butISFwT-Wl7EV0hUK0BQ/featured) and the **videos that complement the curriculum.**

A personal favorite these days? “JavaScript and the HTML DOM” by [Beau Carnes](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-i-made-the-most-out-of-my-freecodecamp-journey-3f54679e0546/undefined).

You don’t want to miss it.

#### 3. The Guide

The [freeCodeCamp Guide](https://guide.freecodecamp.org/) is this “everything-you’ve-always-wanted-to-know-about-code-but-were-afraid-to-ask” **base of knowledge** that hides behind the curriculum.

It is what displays when you click on a challenge “Get a hint” button.

Yet, in alphabetic order, from Accessibility to XML (Extended Markup Language), it contains much more than just the sum of all the challenges hints.

It is definitely **a place you want to check when some kind of tricky code question pops in your head.**

There’s even a [“Book recommendations” page](https://guide.freecodecamp.org/book-recommendations) just because we can be coders AND like books. ???

#### 4. The Forum

Almost in the same situation as the Guide, [the Forum](https://www.freecodecamp.org/forum/latest) also hides a bit behind the Curriculum and offers a lot more than you’d think.

It is what displays when you click on a challenge “Ask for help” button.

It has **its own sign in access and welcomes you into the freeCodeCamp community where you can connect with other Campers**, discuss different tech questions, ask for help and for feedback.

With the “You can do this!” and the “Getting a developer job” sections, it’s also a great place to share **support and/or motivation**.

#### 5. The News section

Just next to the Curriculum, the Guide and the Forum, the freeCodeCamp site has a [News section](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/) **full of interesting articles**.

Just like for the Youtube channel, it took me months to discover it, and now I’m addicted.

Another place to check when looking for coding resources.

#### 6. The coolest thing: a code radio ?

It is [right here](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8butISFwT-Wl7EV0hUK0BQ) and the description speaks better than anything else: **“24/7 concentration music for programmers”**.

How not to love that?!

#### 7. The podcast

[Interviews with inspiring people](https://freecodecamp.libsyn.com/) about code/tech/startup.

To be honest, I haven’t started listening yet but cannot wait for the moment I’ll make time for it.

#### 8. Social media

You can find freeCodeCamp on [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/freecodecamp/) and on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/freeCodeCamp).

To add some Camp magic on your **professional visibility**, freeCodeCamp is also on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/school/free-code-camp/). You can follow it, add it to any section of your profile, and also [join the alumni group](https://www.linkedin.com/groups/6926280/).

On the tech side, there’s also a [freeCodeCamp group on Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/FreeCodeCamp/) to connect with other Campers.

#### 9. More?

I would think so. There are a few other things you may stumble upon when you go from student to contributing member, but that’s another story.

As a **bonus**, I’ll mention the #100DaysOfCode **collective motivation challenge** led by [Alexander Kallaway](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-i-made-the-most-out-of-my-freecodecamp-journey-3f54679e0546/undefined) on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/_100DaysOfCode).

It’s a **fun and benevolent way to keep yourself on track and meet lots of great people** doing the same thing along the way.

All details are in this [Medium post](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/this-new-year-resolution-will-change-your-life-learn-to-code-with-100daysofcode-562ef2c7ca33) and on the [100DaysOfCode website](https://www.100daysofcode.com/).

So proud I’ll reach first round 40 days soon.

+ If like me, **you started coding after 30 years old**, you’ll want to read [this article](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/stories-from-300-developers-who-got-their-first-tech-job-in-their-30s-40s-and-50s-64306eb6bb27) by [Quincy Larson](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-i-made-the-most-out-of-my-freecodecamp-journey-3f54679e0546/undefined) with so many inspiring stories we can relate to.

And the **freeCodeCamp galaxy is expanding**. What next?

As explained by [Quincy Larson](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-i-made-the-most-out-of-my-freecodecamp-journey-3f54679e0546/undefined) in [this post](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/the-first-billion-minutes-the-numbers-behind-freecodecamp-the-tiny-nonprofit-thats-teaching-9c2ee9f8102c), **2019 is about 3 main projects**.

1. The **multi-lingual** freeCodeCamp in Arabic, Chinese, Portuguese, Russian and Spanish to help people learn in their mother-tongue.
2. A **classroom mode** to help teachers use freeCodeCamp more easily.
3. Better tools for **local study groups** in cities around the world.

I must say the third one lights sparkle in my eyes. **I’d love to join a freeCodeCamp group in Paris! Who’s with me?**
