Last weekend, we hosted Hack36, our first-ever hackathon at Motilal Nehru National Institute of Technology in Allahabad. It was easily one of the largest student-lead hackathons in India.

Over **600 developers** from **21 different cities** across India signed up for the event, vying for **100,000 Indian Rupees** in prizes.

After a thorough analysis of their resumes, as well as open source profiles, we chose 180 hackers to compete.

We also had guest speakers, including the creator of freeCodeCamp.org himself, [Quincy Larson](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/top-ideas-products-from-hack36-mnnits-first-hackathon-fecc37833d6e/undefined).

As the tech coordinator of the event, I got to interact with all 52 teams personally. Not all the teams were able to implement their idea, but all of them did a commendable job during those 36 hours.

Since I had a firsthand insight of all the products developed, I decided to share the winners and my own top picks from Hack36.

### DEXTER — First Place

**Team:** Abhishek Sharma, Himanshu Shekhar, Souvik Sen, Madhurjya Pegu  
**Code:** [https://github.com/himanshub16/dexter](https://github.com/himanshub16/dexter)

Ever wondered if you could talk to your computer in your natural language, and it writes the code for you, and that too in your favorite language? Well, **Dexter** is an AI-based code editor that allows you to code simultaneously in JavaScript and Python just by conversing with it.

It supports two of the most widely used languages in the country, Hindi and English. And in my opinion, it has, perhaps, the best design and interface among all the products developed.

### Jarvis Bot — First Runner Up

**Team:** Mohit Khare, Abhey Rana, Prabhat Singh, Avishek Santhaliya  
**Code:** [https://github.com/mkfeuhrer/JarvisBot](https://github.com/mkfeuhrer/JarvisBot)

It’s an intelligent bot that lets you perform utility and fun stuff like games. Built with Python and ZulipChat-API, Jarvis-Bot is the most feature-rich unofficial ZulipChat Bot. It has a bunch of features including dictionary based search and to-do list.

You can even use this bot to log in to a remote system through SSH. The bot also features four interesting games such as Hangman, Scrabble etc, all available at the click of a button. Isn’t it cool ..?

### MedX — Second Runner Up

**Team:** Rashmitha Yellapragada, Gunjan Singh, Naguboyina Sravya, Vrinda Agarwal  
**Code:** [https://github.com/sravya31/hacker-champs](https://github.com/sravya31/hacker-champs)

**MedX** is a platform for easy storage and access of electronic medical records(EMR) that would revolutionize the current health care services. It uses the Ethereum block chain to record patient’s medical information. It grants the user complete control over his/her own medical records and allows to make certain aspects public or private, while still being stored in a decentralized way.

The documents are being stored on IPFS. Moreover, the app also implements certain access control levels to make sure one gets access only to the required data and not the complete medical history of a patient.

### TabORanger — Chrome Extension

**Team:** Abhinav Dixit, Vaibhav Bhardwaj, ARPIT GUPTA, SUSHANT OBEROI  
**Code:** [https://github.com/soc3/TabORanger](https://github.com/soc3/TabORanger)

Developers, in general, have lots of tabs opened in the browser. After a certain number of tabs, it gets really difficult to manage those. TabORanger, a chrome extension, groups tabs on the basis of the web page content using Machine Learning.

The extension also has an option to categorize the tabs on the basis of titles instead of the whole page content to make the whole process much faster.

### SocioIntegrate App

**Team:** Yerra Bala Praneeth Kumar, PRANAYKUMAR ANUGURTI, Poorna Chandu Gade, Kandula Sumanth  
**Code:** [https://github.com/PraneethYerra/hack36-android](https://github.com/PraneethYerra/hack36-android)

This is actually one of my favorites solely due to its unique idea and implementation.The SocioIntegrate App attempts to mitigate the gap between the Facebook Friends engaging them in an Anonymous Chat Game.

The game involves both users connecting randomly based on their interests (data retrieved from Facebook Graph API). Then they play a game (chat till a threshold limit of messages) to reveal the name of their friend. The one who succeeds first gains Flame Points. A user can then use his gained flame points to Prank a Friend on the app itself where the other user doesn’t know the details about him. The Points can also be redeemed at certain outlets.

### EyeVis

**Team:** Akshit Sharma, Divyanshu Kapoor, SATYAM KUMAR GUPTA, Aman Shroff  
**Code:** [https://github.com/khitk9738/EyeVis](https://github.com/khitk9738/EyeVis)

It’s a Project(Python/Android) based on Object detection using Google’s Tensor-flow to provide vision to the blind, further implementing Optical Character Recognition, Read It Aloud, Google translations for different languages & Scene Recognition saving day-to-day problems of millions.

The idea is not much unique but the way the app is hacked using a bunch of APIs and third-party services really makes it stand out from the crowd. The app if implemented properly and trained on a good data set can really make a difference for a certain part of the community.

### **Alexa Care Buddy**

**Team:** Ashish Jha, Rohan Maity, Saumya Wardhan, Siddharth Kathuria  
**Code:** [https://github.com/TheDreamSaver/hack36-alexa-healthcare](https://github.com/TheDreamSaver/hack36-alexa-healthcare)

As the name suggests, it’s an Alexa app that aims to find nearby medical stores on the basis of medicine searched. It also suggests a substitute for the medicine in case the searched medicine is not available.

The app also has an inbuilt navigation to guide a user to the shop. Moreover, the app can also guide you through simple first-aid procedures like the sprain, paper cut etc. It can also teach you common procedures like CPR in cases of emergencies.

### FInal Words

Even though it was only the first of its kind event in the College, the event was a great success. It marked the first of many such developers events yet to be organized. **I hope the legacy continues !!**

**The above list was compiled by me and some interesting ideas might have left out. Please suggest those ideas in the comments. :D**
