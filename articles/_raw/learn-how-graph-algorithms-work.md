Graph algorithms and data structures are used to solve many real-word problems and are commonly needed to solve coding challenges. A graph data structure is a non-linear data structure consisting of vertices and edges.

We just published a course on the freeCodeCamp.org YouTube channel that will help you learn how to use and implement graph data structures with Java.

Haris from Coding Cleverly teaches the graph course using Java. Haris is extremely knowledgable in algorithms and data structures.
