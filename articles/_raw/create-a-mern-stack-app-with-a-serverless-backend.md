The MERN stack is a popular way to make a full stack web app. MERN stands for MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.js.

We just published a course on the freeCodeCamp.org YouTube channel that will teach you how to use the MERN stack by building a restaurant review web app. All you need to know beforehand is some basic JavaScript.

But this course is even better than most MERN stack tutorials. After the entire MERN stack app is complete, you will learn how to refactor the app to make the backend completely serverless. The new backend will use MongoDB Realm instead of Express and Node.

Not only can you host your backend completely free on MongoDB Realm, you can also host your React frontend there as well. You will learn how to do all of that in this course.

Here are all the sections in this course:

* MongoDB overview
* Setup MongoDB Atlas Cloud Database
* Load sample data into database
* Create Node / Express backend
* Create React frontend
* Setup MongoDB Realm and replace backend
* Host frontend on MongoDB Realm

This course was made possible through a grant from MongoDB.

Watch the full course below or [on the freeCodeCamp.org YouTube channel](https://youtu.be/mrHNSanmqQ4) (2-hour watch).
