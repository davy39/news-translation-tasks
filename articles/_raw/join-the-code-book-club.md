By Madison Kanna

Are you learning to code in 2020? 

Or are you already working as a developer but want to level up your skills?

I'd like to invite you to join the CodeBookClub.

We are hundreds of developers of all experience levels learning together. We hold live online meetups on Zoom free video conference software. We pair program, hold group coding sessions, and read/discuss tutorials, courses and technical books together.   
  
If you'd like to join, head to the bottom of this post to join the Discord and become a member in under 2 minutes.

Here are some of our upcoming meetings:

## The 'You Don't Know JS' weekly book club. 

Every other Sunday at 2pm PST/5pm EST, we read a chapter of Get Started, book 1 in Kyle Simpson's free You Don't Know JS book series.

Feel free to join the weekly reading at any time. You don't have to come to every meeting, and we'll go over discussion questions to cement what we learned, and help each other get clarity on whatever concepts or ideas we are still confused on or struggling with.

Kyle Simpson himself recently joined our live call for a Q&A session!

## CodeWars group coding sessions

We hold group coding sessions, where we tackle CodeWars problems together. This is a great way to practice coding, communication, and other skills that will help you when you do technical interviews.

We hold CodeWars meetings every other Sunday at 2:00PM PST / 5PM EST.

If you can't make it to this session, there will be more of them announced every month! 

## If you're interested in attending any of our free meetups, here's how to join the club.
