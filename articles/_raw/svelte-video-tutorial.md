Learn Svelte in this full video tutorial from [Classsed](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC2-slOJImuSc20Drbf88qvg). You will build your first Svelte app that uses multiple routes, handles forms and consumes a full CRUD API.

Svelte is a new approach to building user interfaces. It is a framework that really isn't a framework. Whereas traditional frameworks like React and Vue do the bulk of their work in the browser, Svelte shifts that work into a compile step that happens when you build your app.

After watching this video tutorial, you will have a good idea about how Svelte works. And you may even decide you like it more than React or Vue.

You can watch the full video course on the [freeCodeCamp.org YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhGiGqZ78Rs) (1 hour watch).
