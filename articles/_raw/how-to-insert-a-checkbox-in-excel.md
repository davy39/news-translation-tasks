Microsoft Excel is a dynamic data analysis tool you can use to do virtually anything. From charting, graphing, and financial analysis to interactive forms and to-do lists, it's got you covered.

If you want to use Excel to make a To-do list, an interactive form, or a printable form, then you might need to insert a checkbox.

In this article, I will show you how to insert a checkbox in Excel by using the Developer tab.

In Excel, the developer tools are not shown by default, so you might be asking…

## How do I Enable the Developer Tools in Excel?

**Step 1:** Right-click anywhere on the menu bar and select “Customize the Ribbon”.

You can repeat the process for other checkboxes if you want the functionality.
