By Rohan Taneja

Flutter is Google’s mobile app SDK for crafting high-quality native interfaces on iOS and Android in record time. Flutter works with existing code, is used by developers and organisations around the world, and is free and open source.

For a long time, I’ve been thinking about creating a list of awesome resources that would help anyone get started with Flutter. If you already know what Flutter is and why it is awesome, keep reading.

If you’d like to know more about Flutter, I’d recommend that you read about it [here](https://flutter.io/) and [here](https://hackernoon.com/whats-revolutionary-about-flutter-946915b09514). Once you’re sold on the idea of Flutter, you can come back to this article.

I’ve tried out most of the resources mentioned below, and they’ve helped me get acquainted with Flutter quickly. A few others mentioned below are very popular in the Flutter community.

### 1. FragmentedCast

This one is gold ?. Before you dive into coding Flutter apps, you should really go through the following two episodes. They’ll help you understand how Flutter came into existence and what it is capable of:

[**118: Flutter with GDE Eugenio Marletti — Part 1**](http://fragmentedpodcast.com/episodes/118/)  
[_In this episode, we dive into one of our most requested topics and highly anticipated ones — Flutter. To help us…_fragmentedpodcast.com](http://fragmentedpodcast.com/episodes/118/)[**119: Flutter with GDE Eugenio Marletti — Part 2**](http://fragmentedpodcast.com/episodes/119/)  
[_In part 2 of this series, To help us understand Flutter in-depth we talk to Flutter’s GDE Eugenio Marletti. In Part 1…_fragmentedpodcast.com](http://fragmentedpodcast.com/episodes/119/)

If I had not listened to these back in March, I probably wouldn’t have been excited to try out Flutter immediately. The two episodes include everything you need to know about the “What” and “How” of Flutter.

### 2. Flutter Docs

It may seem obvious, but the official documentation is really, really good and thorough. It includes easy to grasp examples for basic use cases. The best part is that it also includes documentation for seasoned Android, iOS, React Native and Web developers, so that you can easily relate Flutter to your current knowledge:

* [Flutter for Android devs](https://flutter.io/flutter-for-android/)
* [Flutter for iOS devs](https://flutter.io/flutter-for-ios/)
* [Flutter for React Native devs](https://flutter.io/flutter-for-react-native/)
* [Flutter for Web devs](https://flutter.io/web-analogs/)

### **3. Google Codelabs**

A step-by-step guide to building awesome Flutter apps? What kind of a beginner wouldn’t want that? This is a must go-through for every beginner.

[**_Google Codelabs_**](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/?cat=Flutter)

### 4. awesome-flutter: Github repository

[**Solido/awesome-flutter**](https://github.com/Solido/awesome-flutter)  
[_awesome-flutter — All Flutter resources to start and develop your projects !_github.co](https://github.com/Solido/awesome-flutter)

**The** **ultimate guide** to Flutter resources. A bit overwhelming for beginners, but have a look at the ‘Video Series’ section, ‘Blogs’ section, and the apps under ‘Templates’. You’ll utilise the other sections once you’ve begun your journey with Flutter!

### 5. Udacity Course

[**Build Native Mobile Apps with Flutter | Udacity**](https://in.udacity.com/course/build-native-mobile-apps-with-flutter--ud905)  
[_Learn from experts at Google how to use Flutter to craft high-quality native interfaces on iOS and Android devices in…_in.udacity.com](https://in.udacity.com/course/build-native-mobile-apps-with-flutter--ud905)

A **free** course from the Flutter team at Google. Having learned from Udacity for over three years now, I’d highly recommend that you go through this course when you start. It’d take you approximately two weeks to get through it (or two days if you’re really passionate about Flutter). You’ll come out with a much better understanding of how Flutter works and the best practices for coding Flutter apps.

Even if you don’t have prior experience with Dart, you can go ahead with this course as it is really easy to pick up, especially if you already have experience with Java or JS.

### 6. Flutter Weekly

Flutter Weekly is a newsletter that brings you the top Flutter posts, blogs, tutorials, and so on right to your inbox **every week**. So you don’t need to go around looking for the best blogs. Just practice hands-on throughout the week and learn from the latest Flutter resources on the weekend. You can also submit yours when you write one.

### **7. @r_FlutterDev: Twitter**

This twitter bot tweets everything from the [r/FlutterDev](https://www.reddit.com/r/FlutterDev/) Flutter sub-reddit. To get the latest updates as soon as they are out, use the ‘Turn on mobile notifications’ feature on Twitter for this account.

### 8. MTechViral: YouTube

MTechViral is a YouTube channel that provides tutorials for mobile apps. The channel contains a playlist for Flutter tutorials. The tutorials are really good and a new one comes up quite frequently. There’s a corresponding Facebook group called ‘[Let’s Flutter](https://www.facebook.com/groups/425920117856409/)’ and you’ll find a lot of Flutter enthusiasts there answering queries for each other.

### Wrapping up

If you already have an idea about Flutter and have been using it for a while, there are a few places that can provide you help immediately if you ever get stuck implementing a particular functionality:

1. [Gitter Chat](https://gitter.im/flutter/flutter)**:** You’ll find Flutter GDEs, Googlers, and other Flutter enthusiasts answering your queries here.
2. Slack**:** [Mindorks](https://mindorks.com/join-community).
3. Twitter**:** You can find [Eugenio Marletti](https://twitter.com/workingkills) (Flutter GDE)**,** [Seth Ladd](http://twitter.com/@sethladd) (Product Manager, Google) and [Nilay Yener](http://twitter.com/nlycskn) (Flutter Developer Relations team) spreading the Flutter love on Twitter and helping the Flutter community grow. Keep an eye on their tweets to know about the latest Flutter events, conferences, live streams, and so on.
4. Facebook**:** [Flutter Mobile App Developers](https://www.facebook.com/groups/392934177836346/), [Let’s Flutter](https://www.facebook.com/groups/425920117856409/)

If you want to learn with a group full of Flutter enthusiasts, you can also connect with your [nearest Google Developers Group](https://developers.google.com/programs/community/gdg/directory/) and ask them to host a #FlutterExtended event.

_So… how do you feel about Flutter?_
