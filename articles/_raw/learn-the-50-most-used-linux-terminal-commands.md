Touch cat tail. Find man head. Who?

The previous seven words are common Linux commands. If you are a programmer, you are likely going to need to use Linux and terminal commands at some point. 

We just published a course on the freeCodeCamp.org YouTube channel that will teach you how to use the 50 most common Linux and terminal commands.

All these commands work on Linux, macOS, WSL, and anywhere you have a UNIX environment.

Colt Steele developed this course. Colt is one of the most popular web development teachers out there and he is an excellent teacher.
