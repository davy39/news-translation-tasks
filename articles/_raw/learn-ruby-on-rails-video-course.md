Ruby on Rails is a web development framework that makes developing full stack web apps simpler and quicker compared to many other frameworks. Ruby on Rails provides the basic structure needed to create web pages, web services, and databases.

We've released a full course on the freeCodeCamp.org YouTube channel that will help you learn Ruby on Rails by building a friends list app.

The course was created by John Elder from Codemy.com. John has written two best-selling Ruby on Rails books and has created many video courses.

In this course you will build an app that keeps track of your friends' contact information. You will learn how to implement CRUD functionality. CRUD stands for Create, Read, Update, and Destroy and is used in almost all web apps.

Here are the topics covered in this course:

* Introduction and Installation
* First Webpage and MVC Overview
* Application Partial Links and New Pages
* CRUD Scaffold
* Style App with Bootstrap
* Style Devise Views
* Associations
* Style Modifications
* Fun With the Controller
* Git, GitHub, and Heroku

Watch the full course on [the freeCodeCamp.org YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fmyvWz5TUWg) (4-hour watch).
