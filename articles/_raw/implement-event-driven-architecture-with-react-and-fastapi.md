An event driven system is a common way to setup software. In event-driven architecture, event-handlers are registered for specific events. When an event occurs, the handlers are invoked.

A great way to understand this concept is to build a project. We just published a course on the freeCodeCamp.org YouTube channel that will teach you how to code an event-driven system with React, FastAPI, and Redis.

Antonio from Scalable Scripts developed this course. Antonio is an experienced developer. We've published quite a few courses from him and they are always great.

You will learn to use the Finite State Machine pattern. The program will change the state every time there is a new event.

Here are the topics covered in this course:

* Redis Database
* FastAPI Setup
* Create Delivery Endpoint
* Building the State
* State Endpoint
* Dispatching Multiple Events
* Building the State without Redis
* Building the Frontend

Watch the full course below or [on the freeCodeCamp.org YouTube channel](https://youtu.be/NVvIpqmf_Xc) (2 hour watch).
