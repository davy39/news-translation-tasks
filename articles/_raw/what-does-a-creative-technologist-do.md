On paper, I studied computer science. However, most of my passions were artistic: writing, storytelling, and content creation. Over time, I found myself blending both worlds without recognizing it.

Then I came across the term Creative Technologist and realized, "Oh, so that's what I've been doing."  
Even though my tech career path isn't totally defined yet (the tech world is constantly evolving), I've discovered a niche where my skills naturally fit together: merging code, culture, and creativity.

That is what being a creative technologist entails. If you've ever wondered if you could combine technical talents with creativity, this article will explain what the role is, what skills are required, and why it's becoming more important than ever.

## What Does a Creative Technologist Do?

A creative technologist is someone who combines technical knowledge with creative intuition to turn ideas into usable digital experiences. Think of a creative technologist as a bridge builder, someone who links storytelling, design, and technology to enable innovation.

Some people jokingly label them "jacks of all trades." In actuality, they are more like translators, ensuring that creativity and code communicate well.

## Key Skills Every Creative Technologist Needs (with Examples)

Unlike traditional roles, a creative technologist’s skill set is hybrid and exploratory. Here are some of the most important skills, with examples from my own journey:

### Technical Know-How

A creative technologist must have enough technical knowledge to work across multiple mediums. This is not about knowing every programming language, but about being able to choose the best tool for the job. It's the toolset that enables experimenting.

* Web development (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, or frameworks like React and Django)
    
* Mobile app development (Flutter, React Native, or Swift/Kotlin basics)
    
* Design and prototyping tools (Figma, Canva, or Adobe Suite)
    
* Low-code/no-code platforms (WordPress, Wix, Webflow, or Bubble)
    

*Example:*\*\* In my own projects, I’ve switched between Python/Django for custom builds and WordPress/Wix for quick websites. Having that range of technical fluency means I can adapt to different project needs without being stuck in one medium.

### Creative Prototyping

This is the process of immediately turning ideas into real experiments, rather than waiting for a finished product. It's less about the tool and more about the mindset: hacking, sketching, and testing to discover what's feasible.

*Example:*\*\* For my undergraduate project, I built a prototype African literature e-book reader using Python and Django. It wasn’t just code, it was an experiment in accessibility and cultural preservation.

### Cultural and Contextual Thinking

Identifying points of intersection between technology and culture, as well as asking how products serve human needs beyond functionality.

**Example:** On my Substack blogs (The Pop Radar and Story & Scene), I wrote about how pop culture sparks tech innovations, like Jennifer Lopez’s dress influencing the creation of Google Images.

### Translating Between Worlds

Acting as a bridge between highly technical teams (developers) and highly creative teams (designers, writers, marketers).

**Example:** I worked with startups where I turned business ideas into creative assets, like building branded websites with Wix and WordPress, while also shaping their visual storytelling through graphics and video.

### Storytelling and Experimentation with Technology

Creative technologists use tools, from design and video to AI, AR, and Web3, to communicate ideas in fresh ways and to explore how new technologies can expand the creative process.

**Example:** I’ve collaborated with AI tools like ChatGPT and DALL·E in content production. I used them for research, brainstorming ideas, and shaping the plot for a social media brand identity ad. I’ve also created humorous explainers on Web3 that broke down intimidating tech concepts using cultural analogies. In both cases, technology became a way to experiment, simplify, and tell better stories.

If you’re wondering how to start building these skills, you don’t need a formal education. Many creative technologists begin by experimenting on their own, taking online courses, prototyping small projects, writing about culture and tech, or contributing to open-source work. What matters most is curiosity and a willingness to explore where creativity and technology overlap.

## How Is This Different From UX?

It’s a fair question because creative technologists and UX designers often work side by side. But the focus is slightly different:

* **UX/UI designers** are concerned about usability and aesthetics. Their main job is to ensure that a product is user-friendly, accessible, and visually appealing. They conduct user research, generate wireframes, design interfaces, and test how real users interact with a product.
    
* **Creative technologists** sit at the intersection of creativity and technology. Instead of simply improving an app's flow, they tackle bigger questions: What could this product be?  How does it connect with culture? What new technology or mediums could make this experience more interesting?
    
    They experiment, prototype, and occasionally even code to make ideas a reality.
    

Think of it this way:

* A UX designer might redesign a fintech app to make it easier to use.
    
* A creative technologist might question why everything in the Nigerian tech ecosystem is fintech, then prototype an app that connects new homeowners with nearby handymen, plumbers, electricians, and other essential services.
    

By paying attention to cultural and everyday needs, creative technologists can spark innovation in areas that are often overlooked. While UX is a defined role with clear processes, creative technologist is an umbrella role that blends design, code, experimentation, and cultural insight.

## **Why Creative Technologists Matter More Than Ever**

So why is this hybrid role even necessary? The tech world is rapidly evolving. With AI automating many repetitive coding and design activities, the future belongs to those who can bridge the gap across disciplines.

To put it simply, a creative technologist is someone who can translate abstract creative thoughts into practical products, understands the culture in which technology exists, and can construct or prototype when necessary. In a world where roles are increasingly multidisciplinary, this blend of skills isn’t optional, it’s essential. Designers may concentrate on interfaces, developers on backend logic, and writers on narrative. However, the creative technologist sits at the intersection, ensuring that all of these pieces come together to build something innovative and human-centered.

Because the role is fluid, there isn’t a standard “creative technologist salary.” Pay varies depending on the core job, such as design, development, or innovation strategy. Someone in an agency, for example, may be paid like a UX designer, whereas in a huge tech business, they may be compensated more like a product developer or innovation lead.

## Conclusion

“Creative technologist” isn’t a rigid job title. It’s an umbrella term for anyone combining creativity and technology in meaningful ways. Whether through coding, design, research, or storytelling, the value lies in bridging gaps, asking new questions, and building solutions that resonate with people.
