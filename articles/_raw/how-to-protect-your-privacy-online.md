In today’s growing cyber threat landscape, it is important to learn how to protect yourself. In this article, I'll share my five favorite tools you can use to protect your privacy online.

## Why Online Privacy is Important

Have you ever wondered how valuable your data is?

Every app, website, and business is fighting to get more information about you. The more they know, the better they can predict what you want. Sometimes even before you do.

Personal privacy protects us from potential harm or unwanted intrusions into our lives. It also allows us to maintain our dignity and autonomy.

Most importantly, personal privacy is our fundamental right. Without it, we are just data points used to train an AI model.

Cynics argue that “personal privacy is a relic of the past”. Not really.

In today’s data-hungry world, it is still possible to protect your privacy and use the great products the internet offers.⁠ Here are five tools that will help you protect your privacy online.

Brave is a web browser that focuses on privacy and security. It blocks third-party ads and tracks cookies by default. It also allows users to control which ads they see and how their data is used.

Here are a few of the key features that set Brave Browser apart:

* **Privacy:** Brave blocks third-party ads and tracking cookies by default, which helps protect your privacy online.
* **Security:** Brave uses HTTPS Everywhere to upgrade insecure websites to secure HTTPS connections. This helps protect you from man-in-the-middle attacks and other forms of online surveillance.
* **Performance:** Brave uses the same technology as Google Chrome — the Chromium open-source project. This means it is fast, stable, and has support for the latest web standards.
* **Rewards:** Brave allows users to earn rewards in the form of the [Basic Attention Token (BAT)](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/basic-attention-token.asp) for viewing privacy-respecting ads. This gives users a way to support the websites they visit and content creators they enjoy, without having to share their data with advertisers.

Brave browser offers a combination of privacy, security, and performance. Brave is a safer alternative to Chrome or Edge to protect your privacy.

Have I Been Pwned (HIBP) is a website that helps you to check if your personal information has been exposed to a data breach.

Security researcher Troy Hunt created HIBP in 2013. It has since become a widely-used resource for checking compromised personal information.

If HIBP finds that your information is exposed, it will recommend steps you can take to protect yourself. These may include changing passwords, enabling two-factor authentication, and so on.

Here are some features of HIBP:

* **Data breach search:** You can enter your email address or username to see if it has been included in any of the data breaches in the HIBP database.
* **Notification service:** You can sign up for HIBP’s notification service, which will alert you if your email address appears in a new data breach.
* **Breached password search:** You can enter a password to see if it has appeared in any data breaches. This can help you determine if a password is secure or if you should change it.
* **Pwned Password API:** HIBP offers an API that lets developers use the breached password search feature in their own applications.
* **Data breach statistics:** HIBP provides statistics on data breaches. This includes the number of records compromised and the types of data that were exposed.

Even if you set a strong password, the applications you use can encounter a data breach. HIBP helps you keep track of these breaches and make sure your data is secure.
