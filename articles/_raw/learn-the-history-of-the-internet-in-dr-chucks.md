The impact of networks and technology continues to increase. Understanding technology makes it easier to function in an information-centric world.

We just published a massive course about Internet history and technology on the freeCodeCamp.org YouTube channel.

In this course you will learn how the Internet was created, who created it, and how it works. Along the way you will see interviews with many of the innovators who developed the Internet and Web technologies that we use today.

Charles Severance (a.k.a. Dr. Chuck) created this course. He is a Clinical Professor at the University of Michigan School of Information, where he teaches various technology-oriented courses including programming, database design, and Web development.

After this course you will not take the Internet and web for granted. You will be better informed about important technological issues currently facing society. You will realize that the Internet and Web are spaces for innovation and you will get a better understanding of how you might fit into that innovation.

Here are the sections in this information-packed course:
