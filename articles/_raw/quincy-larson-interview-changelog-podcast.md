This week the teacher who founded freeCodeCamp, Quincy Larson, went on a rare public interview with popular open source podcast The Changelog.

During the one-hour interview, open source enthusiasts Adam Stacoviak and Jerod Santo reflected on freeCodeCamp's accomplishments over the past 7 years.

They asked Quincy questions about a wide variety of topics, including:

* The [upcoming Data Science curriculum expansion](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/building-a-data-science-curriculum-with-advanced-math-and-machine-learning/)
* freeCodeCamp's 500-year-old pedagogical roots
* and freeCodeCamp's quest to turn continuing adult education into a video game

Adam used the expression "Nonprofit Unicorn", which comes from an essay by serial entrepreneur Darrell Silver, who [is donating $150,000 to freeCodeCamp](https://darrellsilver.medium.com/why-im-donating-150k-to-freecodecamp-to-help-fund-their-next-big-curriculum-ffb7ff4ae828) to help freeCodeCamp build a variety of new Data Science certifications.

You can listen to the full podcast for free here (1 hour listen):
