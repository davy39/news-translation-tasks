There are a lot of REST API tutorials out there but many of them do not teach you how to create production-ready code using industry best practices.

We just published a course on the freeCodeCamp.org YouTube channel that will teach you how to create a REST API using industry-level .NET code. You will learn how to write code similar to what they write at top tech companies.

Amichai Mantinband created this course. Amichai is a software engineer at Microsoft and before that he worked as a college computer science instructor. 

This course is a concise, start-to-finish video that developers can use as a template to onboard/structure small to medium sized industry-level CRUD applications.

Here are the sections covered in this course:

* Backend server architecture
* Implementing logic of API model
* Refactoring routes
* Create model for request data
* Create service interface
* Implement additional methods
* Handling errors
* Refactoring controller and services
* Refactoring error handling
* Testing API requests

Watch the full course below or [on the freeCodeCamp.org YouTube channel](https://youtu.be/PmDJIooZjBE) (1-hour watch).
