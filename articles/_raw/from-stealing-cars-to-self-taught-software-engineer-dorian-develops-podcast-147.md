On this week's episode of the podcast, I interview Dorian Develops. He's a software engineer and prolific YouTube creator.

Dorian grew up in the Little Havana neighborhood of Miami. He's the child of a single mother that arrived as a refugee from Cuba. After a rough childhood and dropping out of high school in 9th grade, Dorian eventually made a living as a valet parker in Las Vegas. It was here that he realized he needed to make changes for the sake of his family's future.

Dorian taught himself to code using freeCodeCamp and other free learning resources, and has since gotten several 6-figure jobs as a web developer.

We talk about:

* How Dorian survived his 20s by waiting tables and parking cars in Las Vegas
    
* How he taught himself to code using free learning resources and built his network through months of attending local developer meetups
    
* How he's worked as a remote developer so he and his kids can travel the world
    
* And how he's 1 year into his recovery from a lifetime of drug and alcohol addiction
    

Can you guess what song I'm playing in the intro?
