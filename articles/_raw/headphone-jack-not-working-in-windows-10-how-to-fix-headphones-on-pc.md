In general, a headphone jack and a pair of headphones improve the sound from your PC. You'll be able to hear things more clearly, without disturbing other around you.

But sometimes, setting them up is difficult. Or they might stop working entirely. This could be due to outdated drivers, or even physical damage.

In this guide, I'll take you through three ways you can fix your headphone jack on a Windows 10 PC.

## How to Fix Headphone Jack Not Working by Updating Audio Drivers

When any hardware device stops working, my first recommendation is to update its drivers.

Updating your Windows 10 OS could install the necessary drivers for you, but it doesn't happen all the time.

**You can update the audio driver on Windows 10 with the steps below**

**Step 1**: Right-click on Start and choose Device Manager

And the latest driver will be installed for your audio device.

## How to Fix Headphone Jack Not Working by Running Audio Troubleshooter

When any hardware or external device doesn't work, running the appropriate troubleshooter could make it work again.

Please note that your computer must be connected to the internet to get troubleshooting recommendations.

**On Windows 10, you can run audio troubleshooter with the steps below**

**Step 1**: Press `WIN` (Windows logo key) + I to launch Settings

**Step 2**: Select Updates and Security from the menu tiles

## How to Fix Headphone Jack Not Working by Enabling your Audio Device

**You can enable your audio device and set it as the default with the following steps:**

**Step 1**: Press the` WIN` key on your keyboard and search for "control panel". Hit `ENTER` to open the first search result, which is always Control Panel.
