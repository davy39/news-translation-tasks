Git and GitHub are used frequently by developers everywhere. These tools are used at most software companies and so they are important to understand if you want a job in the software industry. 

We've released a crash course video from [Gwen Faraday](https://twitter.com/faradayacademy) that will teach you the basics of Git and GitHub.

Git is a piece of software that makes it simpler to manage different versions of your own software in a software repository.  GitHub is a place to share software repositories and collaborate with other developers. These tools make it easier for multiple people to work on the same software project.

In this course you will learn about:

* common terms
* installing Git
* creating a Git repository
* cloning a Git repository
* adding and removing from a Git repository
* using GitHub
* creating pull requests
* branching repositories
* merging repositories
* and more

By the end of the course, you'll know _way_ more about Git than the people in this web comic. :)
