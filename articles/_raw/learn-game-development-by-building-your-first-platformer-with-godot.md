Ever wanted to build your own video game but felt overwhelmed by where to start?

We just published a course on the [freeCodeCamp.org](http://freeCodeCamp.org) YouTube channel that will guide you step-by-step from a blank screen to a complete, playable game using the powerful and free Godot Engine.

This comprehensive tutorial is designed specifically for beginners, introducing every concept in a simple and approachable way.

Throughout the course, you will learn how to:

* Set up the Godot Engine and get comfortable with the editor.
    
* Design and build levels using your own custom tile sets.
    
* Create a player character with animations for running and idle states.
    
* Implement essential game mechanics like checkpoints, a death system, and a scoring system.
    
* Add challenges with moving platforms and enemies that chase the player.
    
* Incorporate collectibles that increase the player's score.
    
* Structure a larger game with multiple, switchable levels.
    
* Export your finished project so it can be played in a web browser.
    

Another unique thing about this course is the creators, Sarah and Reem. They are 16 and 17-year-old high school students and members of Hack Club, a global nonprofit that empowers young people to build with technology. They’ve built an incredible, beginner-friendly resource to help anyone who has wanted to make a game but didn't know how to start.
