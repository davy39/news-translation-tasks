_Time’s Square during last year’s New Year’s Eve celebration, packed with brave souls who can go all night without a bathroom break._

And most importantly, if you go out, you’ll miss #Open2017.

#Open2017 is a 4-hour interactive live stream — for developers, by developers.

We’ll get started one hour before the ball drops in New York City, then continue streaming until midnight in San Francisco.

That’s right — we’re going to ring in the new year 4 times — each time with exciting new guests:
