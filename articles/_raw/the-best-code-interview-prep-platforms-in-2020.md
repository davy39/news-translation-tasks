Software developer interviews are rapidly evolving. Years ago, mastering data structures and common algorithms was enough to ace an interview and get a job. Today though, employers want candidates with real-world experience and skills. 

That’s why many interviewers won’t even ask data structure or algorithm questions at all. Instead, they'll focus on proficiencies with full-stack technologies and collaboration skills. 

Job seekers would be wise to practice code challenges and take mock interviews to make sure they’re prepared. There are countless books and resources, such as [Cracking The Coding Interview](https://www.amazon.com/Cracking-Coding-Interview-Programming-Questions/dp/0984782850), and [popular online code challenge websites](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/the-8-most-popular-coding-challenge-websites-of-2020/). 

In addition to those resources, here are the best code interview prep platforms for developer candidates.

Frequently considered the best source for interview articles, tips, and content, Interview Cake is a crash course in getting a software development job.

Interviewing.io takes a very unique approach to coding interview prep. Rather than providing content and practice coding challenges, Interviewing.io has a library of actual video interviews that you can watch, and you can pay to anonymously take a mock interview with an engineering hiring manager. 

You may still need to practice coding on another site, but this is a great investment to get actionable feedback.
