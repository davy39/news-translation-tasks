As you may know, I've been a fan of Replit since way back in 2012. I used early versions of the website when I was learning to code. 

For me, Replit was a place to code my solutions for Project Euler problems, and to practice my Python and JavaScript skills.

Over the past decade, [Replit has come a long way](https://replit.com/). Their team has evolved the coding platform into a full-blown multiplayer IDE where you can collaborate with other developers, and host your apps for free.

One way a lot of people in the freeCodeCamp community use Replit is to program and host their Discord bots. And freeCodeCamp has created comprehensive courses on how you can do this, using Python:

... or JavaScript:

## The Upcoming Rust Course and Python + Repl.web Course

We've partnered with Replit for several years now, and they have created grants to make these courses possible. They are helping us make coding education more accessible to people around the world.

And now I'm thrilled to announce that we're using Replit's tools to create two new programming courses. The first course will be an interactive introduction to coding in Rust. It will feature:

1. An interactive course component where you code in Rust and figure out how to get automated tests to pass.
2. Conceptual slides that explain how Rust works, with syntax examples. You can access these at any time while you're coding your way through the course.
3. And also an end-to-end video walkthrough of the Rust course.

We are planning to push this course live by late October.

We are also building a new Python course that will make use of the new Repl.web framework.

Replit is making these courses possible through a $100,000 grant they've created for our nonprofit. Half of these resources will go toward the development of these new courses. The other half will go toward our ongoing development of [the upcoming Data Science curriculum](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/building-a-data-science-curriculum-with-advanced-math-and-machine-learning/).

For now, I encourage you to check out another course we've made with the help of grants from Replit, focused on their Kaboom.js game development framework. If you want to do some gamedev right in your browser, this is a great place to start:

Happy coding. 💻 😃
