# Possible Careers in Tech

## UI/UX Design

![UI/UX Illustration](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2022/07/Whats-the-Difference-Between-them.png align="left")

*UI/UX Illustration*

If you love aesthetics and enjoy styling things, then UI/UX design might be your career.

### What is UI/UX Design?

**UI** stands for User Interface and refers to the screens, pages, and visual icons that users interact with on a webpage or in an app (buttons, icons, and so on). A well-designed UI helps non-techies and all end-users interact with a product or a service online.

**UX** stands for User Experience and involves helping a product or service improve its customer's service. A good UX can also help grow followers for the brand.

As a UI/UX developer, your job is to design and build out a user's experience for a brand or company.

A UI/UX developer must know and understand how to use the following:

* [**Wireframing**](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/designing-a-website-ui-with-prototyping/): A wireframe is a webpage layout stripped of visual design. You use it to prioritize page elements based on user needs.
    
* [**Prototyping**](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/designing-a-website-ui-with-prototyping/): A prototype is a sample or simulation of a final product used to test and gather feedback. Low-fidelity prototypes might be sketched on paper and don't allow user interaction. High-fidelity prototypes are typically computer-based and allow for mouse and keyboard interaction.
    
* **Mockup**: A mockup allows designers to get an idea of a realistic visual model of a final webpage or application.
    
* **User flow**: A user flow is a way to map out each user's steps when using a product or service. This helps improve the user experience.
    

### What tools do I need to become a UI/UX Developer?

If you're working as a UI/UX developer, you'll likely use tools like:

* [Adobe XD](https://www.adobe.com/products/xd.html)
    
* [Figma](https://www.figma.com/)
    
* [Photoshop](https://www.adobe.com/products/photoshopfamily.html)
    
* [Sketch](https://www.sketch.com/)
    

There are lots of tools, but these are the most popular.

A UI/UX developer designs websites and web apps and helps improve user experience with the need-to-knows mentioned above. You can get inspiration from Behance or dribble if you wish to go down this path.

## Frontend Development

![Frontend Tools Ilustration](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2022/07/frontend-development-tools.png align="left")

*Frontend Tools Illustration*

If you love creating websites, you should consider frontend development.

A frontend developer ensures that a visitor can easily interact with a webpage. They use design tools, various frameworks and libraries, and coding to build websites.

Frontend devs are also client-side developers because they directly build the elements on websites and applications with which users and clients interact.

The leading web technologies used by frontend developers are:

* HTML (HyperText Markup Language):
    

**HTML** lets you build the skeleton of webpages and websites. The markup language defines the web. You can think about it as the structure of a house because it holds all the text and defines every header 0n a website.

* CSS (Cascading Style Sheets):
    

**CSS** is responsible for making the website beautiful. You can think of it like the decor of a house. You use it to give your pages color, animations, and more after the HTML has displayed the text.

* JavaScript:
    

**JavaScript** handles the responsiveness of the website. It gives life to a website, helps make it look fabulous on every device, and makes it more interactive.

You will need basic knowledge of these languages to build a unique and interactive website successfully. Knowing only one of the mentioned tech skills won't be enough to build production-quality applications because you will just be able to create a half-useful website.

Sometimes, frontend developers work hand-in-hand with UI/UX developers.

### What tools do I need to know to become a Frontend Developer?

#### A code editor or an IDE (Integrated Development Environment)

A code editor/IDE is where you'll write your code, debug it, and preview written code.

There are many editors/IDE to choose from, but the most popular ones are [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), [Atom](https://atom.io/), and [Sublime text editor](https://www.sublimetext.com/).

#### [Chrome Developer Tools](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/)

You use Chrome DevTools to debug real-time applications on Chrome. It gives you an understanding of and access to important internal information of a web application. DevTools also helps you understand how to optimize the loading flow and what the browser is doing now.

#### [Git and GitHub](https://github.com/) for version control

I know what you are thinking – [what is a version control system](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/git-and-github-for-beginners/)? It is a system that helps you review your code in stages and keep track of your (and others') revisions. Git is a version control system, and GitHub is an online hosting service for Git repositories.

Say you are working on a landing page, and you messed up the footer, and in the codebase, it seems hard to debug. You can quickly go back to previously committed code on your repository and see your last change(s). Although, you can only see your previous commit when you commit to your repo.

GitHub helps team members work together more efficiently, and you can use it to contribute to open source projects.

## Backend Development

![Backend Tools Ilustration](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2022/07/pexels-photo-276452-1.jpg align="left")

*Backend Tools Illustration*

If you love working with and building things that depend on you, you should be a backend developer.

A backend developer builds and maintains technologies or software necessary to power client-side development components. They are also called server-side developers.

Their work includes:

* Building/maintaining databases
    
* Working with data and application integration
    
* Working with APIs
    
* Building out the core application logic
    

### What tools do I need to become a Backend developer?

Backend devs use almost the same tools as Frontend developers. Here's what you'll find helpful:

* Code editor/IDE: This is used for writing code, debugging, and previewing codebases.
    
* [Chrome developer tools](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/): This helps you debug your code.
    
* [Git and GitHub](https://github.com/): This helps you review your code in stages and makes team-building, collaboration, and open source contributing easier. Any developer can contribute to your project if the repository is public.
    
* SQL or NoSQL server: SQL stands for Structured Query Language. This helps you query databases and interact with them while building an application.
    
* Knowledge of a database
    

### Here are some resources to help you get started in Backend Development:

* [Backend Development and APIs certification](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/back-end-development-and-apis/)

## Data Analysis and Data Science

![Data Science/Analysis Skills Ilustration](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2022/07/pexels-photo-265087.jpg align="left")

*Data Science/Analysis Skills Illustration*

Consider a data analyst career if you love calculating, mathematics, or statistics.

Data analysis involves examining, transforming, and arranging a given data set in specific ways to study its parts and extract useful information. It deals with interpreting, analyzing, and visualizing data.

In layperson's terms, data analysis involves gathering insights from data to aid business decisions.

Data science handles data using machine learning, algorithms, and statistics. It is the statistical part of the data field. Data scientists collect, clean, and interpret data sets for surveys. So data science involves statistically analyzing data.

It's always better to start as a data analyst and then transition to data science because data analysis is the foundation of data science. Although they may be on the same path, there is a fine line between data science and data analysis.

Data is present in every industry, so data scientists and analysts are needed everywhere.

#### Essential technical skills to have for Data Science:

* [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/)
    
* [Python programming language](https://www.python.org/)
    
* Mathematics
    
* Statistics
    
* [R programming language](https://www.r-project.org/about.html)
    

### What tools you would use in this field:

* [Microsoft Excel](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/excel)
    
* [Google Spreadsheets](https://www.google.com/sheets/about/)
    
* [Tableau](https://www.tableau.com/)
    
* [SQL Server](https://www.sqlservertutorial.net/getting-started/what-is-sql-server/)

## Product Management

![Product Management Skills Ilustration](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2022/07/pexels-photo-416405.jpeg align="left")

*Product Management Skills Illustration*

This is for you if you are great at organizing products and teams.

A product manager manages and coordinates product development projects. The product manager is the voice of the customer on the team.

They ensure that the product being built contains the features and requirements needed to satisfy the customer. They're also in charge of drafting out a roadmap for that product, from imagination, all the way to launch. And they are the ones who decide what feature to include in v1 or V2.

Their responsibilities include:

* Understanding user needs,
    
* Drafting out roadmaps for the product being built.
    
* Defining a vision for the products
    
* Developing competitive analyses
    
* Prioritizing product features
    

And lots more.

### Common tools product managers use:

* There are many tools for user tracking and analysis such as [Pendo](https://www.pendo.io/) or [Amplitude](https://amplitude.com/). These apps give insight into users' activity on the software or website.
    
* [Product Plan](https://www.productplan.com/) is a road mapping software to draft out and manage the product plan. They can also handle version-control issues that can slow your product's progress.
    
* Survey Tools such as [Typeform](https://www.typeform.com/surveys/) are very handy. PMs use them to carry out customer or user surveys to help improve the product to users' needs. A product manager can easily track and analyze the results using these tools.
    
* Feature flagging tools such as [Split.io](https://www.split.io/) help teams quickly turn specific features when users have flagged them. This is useful during a notable feature or product launch or testing process.
    
* Flowcharting tools such as [Visio](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/visio/flowchart-software) help create product development workflow and help the product manager structure the user journey on the product.
