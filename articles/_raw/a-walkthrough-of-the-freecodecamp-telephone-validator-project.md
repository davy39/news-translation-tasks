Project 4 from JavaScript Algos and DS Certification.

We're continuing our journey through the FreeCodeCamp JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures Certification! Last project was the **Caesars Cipher**, the third entry in our series. You can [check it out here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_AJ7vx8yRDg&feature=youtu.be).

Now we're doing the **Telephone Validator**. Our job is to determine whether a given phone number is a valid US number or not.

This video covers:

* What regular expressions (RegEx) are.
* Popular regex tools.
* A useful tool to analyze them.
* Testing strings against regex.
* An analysis of two solutions.
    * One is faster, yet harder to read.
    * The other is _just a bit_ slower, but much easier to read.
* and more!

You can watch [the full video on my YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6Yr2PBmwC0).

Here's a link to [the entire playlist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XV5OCibNpLI&list=PLehRZjGCVhQLTWPN8mTo3rlRDQff9fCmT) as well.
