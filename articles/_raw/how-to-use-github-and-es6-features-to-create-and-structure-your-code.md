If you're moving from coding tutorials into creating your own JavaScript projects, you'll want to become familiar with using a version control system like [GitHub](https://github.com/) and benefiting from [ES6 features](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_es6.asp) to clean up your code and streamline your development process.

In this new video, we'll walk through cloning an existing repository from GitHub, creating your own local and remote repositories, utilizing node package manager (NPM) to install dependencies, creating a streamlined code base using ES6 classes, import/export modules, and arrow functions, and adding, committing, and pushing changes to GitHub.

Plus, we'll talk through the basic file structure for a [Phaser 3](https://phaser.io/) project!
