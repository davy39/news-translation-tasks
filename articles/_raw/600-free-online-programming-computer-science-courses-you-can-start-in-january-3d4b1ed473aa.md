Six years ago, universities like MIT and Stanford first opened up free online courses to the public. Today, more than 700 schools around the world have created thousands of free online courses.

I’ve compiled this list of over 600 such free online courses that you can start this month. For this, I leveraged [Class Central](https://www.class-central.com/)’s database of over 9,000 courses. I’ve also included each course’s average rating.

![Image](https://cdn-media-1.freecodecamp.org/images/Qg-p5SwW9w05djuYFN0mdoZkiqgZE4AxjA48)
_[Class Central](https://www.class-central.com/" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title=")’s home page._

I’ve sorted these courses into the following categories based on their difficulty level:

* Beginner
* Intermediate
* Advanced

Courses that are being offered for the first time are marked as **[NEW]**.

Many of these courses are completely self-paced. The rest will start at various times later in January. You can find complete lists of the technology-related courses starting later in 2018 on Class Central’s [Computer Science](https://www.class-central.com/subject/cs), [Data Science](https://www.class-central.com/subject/data-science), and [Programming](https://www.class-central.com/subject/programming-and-software-development) subject pages.

I understand this a long list and might be daunting for learners new to programming. In that case, you might find [David Venturi](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/600-free-online-programming-computer-science-courses-you-can-start-in-january-3d4b1ed473aa/undefined)’s recommendations for the best [Data Science online courses](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/the-best-data-science-courses-on-the-internet-ranked-by-your-reviews-6dc5b910ea40/) useful — even if you’re not looking to learn Data Science. I hope to create more of these guides in the future.

And finally if you have trouble figuring out how to signup for Coursera courses for free, don’t worry — I’ve [written an article on how to do that, too](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-sign-up-for-coursera-courses-for-free-98266efaa531/).
