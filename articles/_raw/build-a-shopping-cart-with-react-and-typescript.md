Many websites have shopping carts and you can create your own using React and TypeScript.

We've released a tutorial on the freeCodeCamp.org YouTube channel that will help you improve your React and TypeScript skills. You'll also learn how to use:

* Material UI
* Styled Components
* and React-Query for React hooks

Swedish software engineer Thomas Weibenfalk created this tutorial. He has created a ton of great tutorials on both his own YouTube channel and the freeCodeCamp channel.

This tutorial uses a free API that gives you sample data for the items in your shop. You'll use React-Query hooks to fetch the data from the API, and Styled Components with Material UI to customize the styles.

Watch the [full tutorial on the freeCodeCamp.org YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfmL6bGbiN8) (1 hour watch).
