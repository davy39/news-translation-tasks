## Question: I just signed into my account and I don't see any of my past progress.

Answer: You have created a duplicate account. [Sign out of your account](https://www.freecodecamp.org/settings) and sign in using a different email address that you may have used in the past.

Note that even though we have a Google sign in option and a GitHub sign in option, we just use that to access your email address. Your account is ultimately tied to your email addresses.

## Question: Why does freeCodeCamp use a sign in code instead of a password?

Sign in codes are much more secure than passwords, and many websites are moving to them. Many websites are [following our lead and moving to one time codes or "magic links" as well](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/360-million-reasons-to-destroy-all-passwords-9a100b2b5001/).

## Question: I am getting an error message when trying to login or save my progress.

Answer: If you are getting an error that says: `'Oops! Something went wrong, Please try again in a moment.'`, you may have a duplicate account with the same email address. Please send an email to our support team: `support@freecodecamp.org` and we will manually merge or remove the duplicate account.

## Question: I set up a monthly donation, but I need to update or stop the monthly recurrence. How can I do this?

Answer: Just forward one of your monthly donation receipts to donors@freecodecamp.org and tell us what you'd like us to do. We'll take care of this for you and send you confirmation.

## Question: When I try to run the code in the [/learn](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn)  code editor, the tests don't seem to run.

Answer: We recommend you use either Firefox or Chrome. Other browsers may not support the latest JavaScript features that our curriculum requires in order to run. Also, check that you do not have any browser extensions that block JavaScript.

## Question: One of my freeCodeCamp challenges freezes and crashes when I open it.

**Answer:** This is caused by an infinite loop in your code editor. [Here's how to fix this](https://forum.freecodecamp.org/t/free-code-camp-infinite-loop-protection/19550).

## Question: How can I delete my freeCodeCamp account? Does this delete all of my data permanently?

Answer: You can delete your account by scrolling to the bottom of [the settings page](https://www.freecodecamp.org/settings). This is permanent, and will really delete all of your data. We cannot undo this for you if you change your mind.

If you aren't able to sign into your account for some reason, or you just want us to delete your data for you, send an email to support@freecodecamp.org from the email address that is associated with your account, and we will take care of this for you.

## Question: I have a support question that isn't answered here.

Answer: [Ask your support question on this section of the forum](https://forum.freecodecamp.org/new-topic?category=support). Our nonprofit's volunteer contributors will our best to help you answer it.
