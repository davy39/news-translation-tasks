You can learn everything you need to know to earn the Azure Data Fundamentals certification by completing this free 4.5 hour course.

# What is the Azure Data Fundamentals Certification?

The Azure Data Fundamentals Certification is for those seeking a data-related role such as **Data Analyst, Data Engineer, or Data Scientist**.

The majority of new technology companies are data-driven, meaning that the value of their company is not directly responsible for the service they provide but the data they collect, organize, and possibly re-distribute.

Knowing the fundamentals of data-driven architectures on day one will help cloud engineers long-term understand the cost and effort to store, transform, analyze and secure data.

# Overview of the Azure Data Fundamentals

The Azure Data Fundamentals covers the following:

* Fundamental data concepts
* Data Lakes and Performing Analytics
* Data Warehouses
* ELT Transformations
* Hadoop and Apache Spark workloads
* Power BI
* Relational Databases and Azure SQL
* Non-Relational Databases and ComosDB

# **How do you get the Azure Data Fundamentals certification?**

You can get the certification by paying the exam fee and sitting for the exam at a test center partnered with Microsoft Azure.

Microsoft Azure is partnered with Pearson Vue and PSI Online who have a network of test centers around the world. They provide both in-person and online exams. If you have the opportunity, I recommend that you take the exam in-person.

Microsoft has [a portal page on Pearsue Vue](https://home.pearsonvue.com/Clients/Microsoft.aspx) where you can register and book your exam.

That exam fee is **$99 USD**.

# Can I simply watch the videos and pass the exam?

For a fundamental certification like the DP-900 you can pass by just watching the video content without exploring hands-on with the Azure services on your own

Azure has a much higher frequency of updates than other cloud service providers. Sometimes there are new updates every month to a certification however, the DP-900 is not hands-on focused, so study courses are less prone to becoming stale.

* The exam has **40 to 60** questions with a timeline of **60 minutes**.
* The exam contains many different question types.
* A passing grade is **around 70%.**

## The Free Azure Data Fundamentals Course

Just like my other cloud certification courses published on freeCodeCamp, this course will remain free forever.
