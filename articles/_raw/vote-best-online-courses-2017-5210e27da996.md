If you haven’t heard, universities around the world offering their courses online for free (or at least partially free).

You can find more than 8,000 such courses on a website I’ve been operating since 2011 called [Class Central](https://www.class-central.com). Class Central’s users have also written more than 30,000 reviews for these courses.

All year long, I’ve been tracking what new courses have been launched across multiple different platforms. In 2017 alone, 350 universities around the world launched nearly 2,000 free online courses.

This is the third time I will be publishing such a list. Here are the lists for [2015](https://www.class-central.com/report/best-free-online-courses-2015/) and [2016](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/best-free-online-courses-of-2016-c479b55ed851/).

My methodology is simple: I will rank these 2,000 courses by the Bayesian average of their ratings, then filter out the ones with less than ten reviews.
