We’re streaming a nonstop game development marathon [this weekend on our Twitch.tv channel](http://twitch.tv/freecodecamp).  
   
JavaScript is a powerful and versatile technology. It’s popular for web development, mobile development, Internet of Things, data visualization, and of course, gaming.

This weekend, our campers will build a variety of games using JavaScript-based technologies.  
   
The show will kick off Friday at 5 p.m. EST on our [Twitch.tv channel](http://twitch.tv/freecodecamp), and continue through Sunday night.

_The World’s Biggest Pac-Man takes the classic game to it’s extremes with HTML5._

JavaScript games will run on any device with a browser, and often don’t require downloading, so they are ideal for indie game developers. With new technologies like [WebAssembly](http://www.quora.com/What-does-WebAssembly-mean-for-those-who-are-currently-learning-web-development/answer/Quincy-Larson), these browser-based games may soon rival Xbox and Playstation games in graphics and gameplay.

_The 2048 puzzle game, built by one person over a single weekend, took the internet by storm in 2014._

Many developers in our community enjoy building video games. While game development jobs are harder to come by than web development jobs, everyone can agree that game development is a lot of fun.
