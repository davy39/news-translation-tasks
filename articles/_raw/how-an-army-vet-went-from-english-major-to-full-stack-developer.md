In this week's episode of the freeCodeCamp podcast, Abbey chats with software developer and army veteran Jami Gibbs about her journey into tech. 

Jami was born and raised in the Chicago area, and her first encounter with programming was in high school. Even though she enjoyed it, she didn't pursue it at the time. While majoring in English in college, she joined the National Guard and did several tours overseas. 

During her time in the army, she came back to the world of tech and started learning more about coding. After leaving the military and finishing her English degree, she realized she wanted to switch careers and commit to becoming a software developer.

She taught herself most of what she knows, supplemented it with a boot camp, and got her first job working on WordPress themes. Through building a number of side projects, enhancing her skills, and working her way up to other tech jobs, Jami reached her current position as a software engineer in Chicago. 

When she's not spending all her free time coding, she runs races, enjoys the Chicago craft beer scene, and roots for the Chicago Bears.

In this episode, Jami discusses the hiring process, what it was like getting a tech job in her 30s, how her time in the army helped during the job hunt, and more.
