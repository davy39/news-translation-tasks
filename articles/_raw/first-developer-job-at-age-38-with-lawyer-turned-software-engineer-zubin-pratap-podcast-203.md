Today Quincy Larson interviews Zubin Pratap, a software engineer and manager from Melbourne, Australia. After nearly two decades working as a corporate lawyer, he taught himself programming using [freeCodeCamp.org](http://freeCodeCamp.org). Within two years, he landed a job as a software engineer at Google.

We talk about:

* How tools are making programming easier, but other parts of being a developer harder
    
* How 2009 - 2022 was NOT a normal job market and how devs are adapting
    
* "The purpose of communication is to be understood" and other lessons Zubin's learned over the years

1. Let's kick off 2026 with a ton of announcements. We just launched Version 10 of freeCodeCamp's JavaScript certification, along with updated Python, SQL, and Responsive Web Design certifications that you can earn. We even launched our beta Spanish and Mandarin Chinese curricula. (10 minute announcement article with tons of data): [https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/christmas-gifts-freecodecamp-community-2025](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/christmas-gifts-freecodecamp-community-2025)
    
2. Now you can learn Spanish on freeCodeCamp. We just launched our FREE A1 Level Spanish curriculum. You'll learn: pronunciation, introductions, numbers, and more. More than 200 steps are live now. ¡Aprendamos!

3. Over the holiday break I took my kids to Johnson Space Center in Houston. If you're in Houston you should absolutely go here. We visited the Mission Control center that NASA used during the Apollo missions to the moon. They also had an awesome multimedia experience created by Tom Hanks about this year's Artemis mission to the moon. This is an incredible museum. We spent 7 hours there. It wasn't particularly expensive. Just make sure you book tickets to mission control a few months in advance of your trip.
    
4. During the road trip, I re-listened to Guns 'n' Roses's entire catalogue. Which brings me to today's song of the week: the 1991 epic Estranged. The is maybe the most mature-sounding song they've ever done, with introspective lyrics and a series of tasteful, emotional guitar solos. Great drum fills, too.
